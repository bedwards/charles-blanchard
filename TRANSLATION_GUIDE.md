# Translation Guide for Charles Blanchard

## About This Translation

This guide establishes the voice and approach for translating Charles-Louis Philippe's
*Charles Blanchard* (1913) into English.

## The Author

Charles-Louis Philippe (1874-1909) was the son of a clog-maker in Cérilly, a small
town in central France. He wrote: "My grandmother was a beggar, my father begged
before he was old enough to work for his bread. I am in France the first person from
a race of the poor to enter the world of literature."

T.S. Eliot, who wrote the preface to the English translation of Philippe's *Bubu de
Montparnasse*, observed that Philippe "is not explicitly concerned with altering things...
he is perhaps the most faithful to the point of view of the humble and oppressed
themselves, is more their spokesman than their champion."

## Target Voice

The translation should read like a lost work that might sit comfortably alongside:

- **Cormac McCarthy's Suttree** - poetic density about poverty and outcasts
- **George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London** - documentary tenderness
- **Fernando Pessoa's Book of Disquiet** - meditative, melancholic circling
- **Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son** - hallucinatory clarity in deprivation
- **J.M. Coetzee** - spare moral weight, unflinching without cruelty

## Core Principles

### 1. Preserve the Circling Quality

Philippe's sentences often loop back, elaborate, and return. Do not modernize these
into punchy short sentences. Let the meditation breathe.

**French:**
```
Il l'attendait, il restait sur sa chaise, il ne faisait pas un geste car il eût
pu lui faire peur, il ouvrait bien les yeux pour qu'elle ne vînt pas sans
qu'il la vît, il rassemblait tous ses membres pour être prêt à l'accompagner
quand elle viendrait.
```

**Good (preserves rhythm):**
```
He waited for it, he stayed in his chair, he made no movement for fear of
startling it, he kept his eyes wide open so it would not come without his
seeing it, he gathered all his limbs to be ready to follow when it came.
```

**Bad (over-modernized):**
```
He waited. He sat still. He didn't want to scare it away. He watched carefully.
He was ready.
```

### 2. Maintain Personification

Houses, cold, hunger, furniture - these are characters with feelings and intentions.
Do not flatten this into mere description.

**French:**
```
Les maisons nous ressemblent. On eût cru qu'une grande douleur qu'elle avait
conçue parce qu'elle était ainsi faite, l'avait portée à s'éloigner des hommes.
```

**Translation approach:**
```
Houses are like us. One might have thought that a great sorrow, conceived
because she was made that way, had led her to withdraw from men.
```

Keep "she" for the house - preserve the animation.

### 3. Concrete Poverty, No Sentimentality

Philippe writes about bread and cheese and cold with love but without pity.
The details are precise, almost documentary, but carry spiritual weight.

**Example of the tone:**
The child cannot eat cheese - this is written with the gravity of tragedy,
but also with the humor of a child's stubborn body. Don't soften it, don't
dramatize it. Let the fact speak.

### 4. The Cold as Character

"Le Froid" (The Cold) is not weather - it is a presence, an antagonist, almost
a theology. Translate it with weight.

### 5. Period-Appropriate but Not Archaic

The English should feel early 20th century - not Victorian, not contemporary.
Think of the prose in Orwell's early work, or E.M. Forster.

**Avoid:** "super," "totally," "kids," "gotten"
**Avoid:** "whilst," "betwixt," "upon" (too archaic)
**Use:** "one might," "it seemed that," "there was about it"

### 6. Preserve Repetition

Philippe repeats words and phrases deliberately. This is not redundancy - it is
incantation. Keep it.

**French:**
```
Il n'y avait pas là cette paix... Il n'y avait pas là ces souvenirs...
Il n'y avait pas là cette lumière...
```

**Keep the anaphora:**
```
There was not here that peace... There were not here those memories...
There was not here that light...
```

| la petite ville | the small town | Not "village" - it's a town |
| le pain | bread | Central symbol - the bread, not "some bread" |
| la mère | the mother / his mother | Context-dependent |

## Chapter-Specific Notes

### 00 - Front Matter
Contains OCR artifacts from library stamps. Translate publisher info but note
that decorative pages have OCR errors.

### 01 - Préface (Preface)
By Léon-Paul Fargue. More lyrical and literary than the main text. Fargue was
a symbolist poet - his prose is more ornate than Philippe's.

### 02-03 - Chapters I & II (Main Text)
The heart of the book. Philippe's purest voice. These should feel like Orwell
crossed with Pessoa.

### 04 - Supplement to First Version
Earlier draft material. May be rougher.

### 05 - Second Version: The Bread
Alternate take. "Le Pain" - bread is the central symbol.

### 06 - Third Version (5 parts)
More developed, episodic. The carousel horses ("Les chevaux de bois") section
is particularly lyrical - think of the merry-go-round as both wonder and cruelty.

### 07 - Variants
Fragments and alternate versions. Some may be rough or incomplete.

### 08-09 - Table of Contents / Back Matter
Translate TOC; back matter is publisher ads and can be summarized.

## Translation Workflow

1. Read the full chapter in French first
2. Translate paragraph by paragraph (not sentence by sentence)
3. Read the English aloud - does it flow? Does it circle?
4. Check against glossary for consistency
5. Compare tone to touchstone authors (McCarthy, Pessoa, Orwell)

## What to Avoid

- **Explaining** - If Philippe leaves something ambiguous, leave it ambiguous
- **Modernizing syntax** - Keep the 1913 sentence structures
- **Flattening metaphor** - If the house is sad, she is sad
- **Adding emotion** - Philippe is restrained; match his restraint
- **Cutting repetition** - The repetition is musical, keep it
