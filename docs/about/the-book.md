# About Charles Blanchard

## The Author

Charles-Louis Philippe was born in 1874 in Cérilly, a small town in the Allier department of central France. His father was a clog-maker—a *sabotier*—who had himself grown up in poverty so severe that he begged for bread as a child. Philippe never forgot this. In a letter to the writer Maurice Barrès, he wrote:

> My grandmother was a beggar, my father, who was a proud child, begged before he was old enough to work for his bread. I belong to a generation which has not yet passed through the world of books.... I must remind you that there are in me more imperative truths than those you call "French truths."

And later:

> That's why my writing is always more tender than my head tells me to write. I think I am in France the first person from a race of the poor to enter the world of literature.

Philippe clawed his way into the literary world through scholarships and sheer determination. He worked as a minor civil servant in Paris while writing, and became part of the circle around the Nouvelle Revue Française—the most influential literary magazine of the era. His novels *Bubu de Montparnasse* (1901) and *Le Père Perdrix* (1903) established him as a distinctive voice: someone who wrote about the poor not as a reformer or a naturalist cataloguing misery, but as one of them.

He died of typhoid fever in 1909, at thirty-five. *Charles Blanchard* was found among his papers, unfinished.

## The Book

*Charles Blanchard* is Philippe's most personal work—a novel about his father's childhood, drawn from stories told across the family dinner table in Cérilly. It is simultaneously autobiography, family history, and something stranger: an attempt to write poverty itself, to give it voice and presence.

The book exists in fragments. Philippe left behind multiple versions: a "first version" in two chapters (The Cold, The Clog-maker's House), a "second version" centered on bread as symbol and antagonist, a "third version" in five episodic parts, and numerous variants and drafts. The 1913 posthumous edition, prepared by his friends and published by the NRF, gathered all of these together.

This is not a conventional novel. It circles back on itself. It tells the same story—a child's experience of poverty—from different angles, in different registers. The house appears again and again. The cold appears. The carousel horses appear. Each version adds something; none supersedes the others.

## Why This Matters Now

Philippe's subject is poverty, but his approach is neither sociological nor sentimental. He does not explain poverty or argue against it. He renders it from inside—the way a seven-year-old experiences being alone in a cold house, waiting for his mother to return. The way hunger shapes time. The way a child learns his place in the world.

T.S. Eliot, who wrote the introduction to the English translation of *Bubu de Montparnasse*, observed that Philippe "is not explicitly concerned with altering things... he is perhaps the most faithful to the point of view of the humble and oppressed themselves, is more their spokesman than their champion."

This is what makes Philippe worth reading now. He is not performing empathy for the poor; he is writing from within a consciousness shaped by poverty. The famous passage about the carousel horses—where Charles watches other children ride while he stands apart, crossing his hands on his belly, occupying "the last place with naturalness"—is not an indictment. It is a precise description of how class becomes identity, how a child internalizes his position before he has words for it.

## Philippe's Place in French Literature

Philippe came after Zola and the Naturalists, but he rejected their determinism and their claims to scientific objectivity. He came before Proust and the modernists, but his meditative, circling prose anticipates their techniques. He belongs to no school.

His closest literary relatives might be:

- **George Orwell** (*Down and Out in Paris and London*) — documentary poverty, tender but unsentimental
- **Cormac McCarthy** (*Suttree*) — poetic prose about outcasts, landscape as character
- **Fernando Pessoa** (*The Book of Disquiet*) — fragmentary meditation, melancholy without self-pity

The philosopher György Lukács called Philippe's form a "chantefable"—a song-fable, something between prose and incantation. This captures the way Philippe's sentences loop and return, the way he builds meaning through repetition rather than progression.

## The Unfinished Question

Why did Philippe leave the book unfinished? The obvious answer is that he died young. But the fragments themselves suggest another possibility: that *Charles Blanchard* resists completion by design.

Each version approaches the same material differently. The "first version" is closest to conventional narrative. The "second version" abstracts the story into symbol. The "third version" breaks it into vignettes. It is as if Philippe kept circling the subject, unable or unwilling to settle on a single form.

Perhaps this is appropriate. Poverty is not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It is a condition—something that shapes consciousness rather than something that happens. The multiple versions of *Charles Blanchard* enact this: they return to the same house, the same cold, the same bread, the same carousel, again and again, each time from a slightly different angle.

The book that Philippe left is complete in its incompleteness.
