    </audio>
    <p class="description">
        The complete first chapter. Charles Blanchard at age seven, alone in the house,
        waiting for his mother to return. The cold as presence, the house as character.

    </audio>
    <p class="description">
        Charles is taken in by his uncle, a clog-maker. The workshop full of tools,
        the warmth of labor, the transformation through work.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="audio-section">
    <h2>The Carousel Horses</h2>
    <p class="duration">~7 minutes</p>
    <audio controls preload="metadata">

        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    <p class="description">
        The most lyrical section of the book. The carousel as spectacle, as class divide,
        as the moment when Charles understands his place among the poor.
    </p>
