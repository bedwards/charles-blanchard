OF CHARLES BLANCHARD

SOLANGE'S WORDS TO CHARLES
BLANCHARD

... One understood quickly that these rooms were inhabited by a master jealous of his power who pressed upon the chamber the weight of a sombre thought that never left him. The child felt himself obey so much will. He would find his place, he would go to his chair without turning his head, she was far away, he was a little afraid, he would sit down and no longer dared move, for fear it might be forbidden.

Sometimes, from that seven-year-old heart, a young blood would escape with a force that seemed able to bring down walls. What would Charles Blanchard do? He was a warrior, he looked around him first. The shadow and the silence mingled together spread that life which they spread. One might have thought he too was about to release his own and send them back to their corners. But no. The shadow and the silence are jealous. They advanced. He felt their breath first. Then that dampness they contain fell into the hollows of his shoulders, then that ice of which they are made pressed a black water upon his warm heart. He had had his fill. He had it up to his neck, he had a mouthful of it, he breathed them, he ate them, he formed his substance from them, he became shadow and silence. Who then has said that Charles Blanchard will go to hear the little bells of Monsieur Tardy's kiosk that ring when a light wind blows?

He knew her well, this house. He could have given you more than one detail about her, and about the bed, and about the table, and about the chairs, and about the bread bin, he could have told more than one bitter story for the furniture was like him subject to the four walls. He could have told you of the woman you have seen motionless in the place that fate had assigned her, whose presence you had scarcely noticed, he could have told you of Solange Blanchard who counted a little more than the furniture.

Solange Blanchard was always seated. She would place herself on her chair, she would set her two elbows upon her knees. She would bend, she would fold in upon herself, she would gather her limbs so as to wrap well what she possessed, so that nothing might escape her, so as to surround with her knees, her arms and her back the poor soul she carried in her body.

Her face was grey. It is rather difficult to know what her dress was like: her dress did not stand out from the colour of the walls. Her hands were grey, and as for the body hidden beneath her garment, one could hardly imagine it was full of red blood, and one remarked only one thing of it: that it contained sighs or, sometimes, that a broken voice came from it. For she spoke. It happened that she added to the shadow and the silence of the house some words that made them heavier still. She said:

"My poor Charles, we are not happy."

She said:

"Your poor father had gone into the countryside, he got overheated. When he wanted to come home, he caught cold. He died of pneumonia in six days."

She also said:

"Do you remember our house when we lived in the town? We were all three very happy. There were two windows, one could watch the world go by and then one had the heart to take some pleasure."

During those afternoons so long in the course of which nothing happens, to prove to ourselves that we are not dead, we would search in the depths of our soul for what might happen. We are not dead. It even seems we are about to enter into full communion with our entire life. Our soul had settled in our heart: we find her, we feel her, she is indeed within us, we are not alone. We then surround her with all our feelings so that she will not leave us, we are very gentle so that she will trust us and tell us her story. Our soul is a younger sister who, when one spends the afternoon beside her, opens up and teaches us about herself things we had not known until then. Solange Blanchard's soul was docile. At the first call she does not keep one waiting: here she is! She is already gaining ground, and in all of a woman's body she takes her place, and in her head, and in her thoughts, she will rise to her eyes, she will take hold of her gaze. Here is my soul! The two trickles of warm water that then flowed over her face came indeed from farther than her eyes and seemed to continue her feelings. She was not surprised. She knew well that this was her soul, these bitter tears that flooded, that overflowed her cheeks and that, through the opening of her mouth, then entered so that she might recognise it by the taste.

Such was Solange Blanchard. But if to depict her it was necessary to tell some traits of her personal life, to understand her one must say that her personal life counted for little. The old house, around her, with all its thatched roof, its four walls, the floor, the ceiling and each of its pieces of furniture, kept silence. The door was closed, not even flies entered. One understood why the window must not receive more light. It seemed that the very darkness lived and listened. A woman was here, Solange or another, charged with a role, and that she was going to fulfil. Neither the roof, nor the walls, nor the ceiling, nor the floor, nor the furniture knew how to weep, and in a world laden with tears, they bore so heavy a burden that someone had to weep for them. They would lean then over that one and encourage her until evening.

When Charles Blanchard, later, recalled the memories of his childhood, he never knew if it was his mother who had wept. The house was a house all in tears.

He lived here without uttering a reproach, without feeling the right to go elsewhere, without showing by a single reflection that he, too, had his own idea. He was like those studious children who go to school, who know nothing of human knowledge and wish to devote their efforts to acquiring it. He submitted to the principles, he conformed to the method. When he sat down, he sat down properly so that no gesture would come to distract him. His head was straight, his eye open, he waited. He was eager to know as much as the master. He received his teaching, he held out his heart like a cup, and whatever the other poured into it, it was precious. One might have said he opened his mouth and drank in long draughts. Sometimes, in moments of rest, he felt within him the taste of that bitter liquor that had been poured for him, he pushed it so that it would find its place, he swallowed the last drop, and whatever it was, it passed and went to join in the hollow of his chest, in the depths of his heart, that blood of children so pure to which it mingled a black water.

ANOTHER BEGINNING

Perhaps it was by chance that Charles Blanchard managed to survive that winter, or perhaps one must see in this a deeper trait and pass a first judgement on this child. One could already say that he had in him enough resources to resist nine years of captivity. Where are they, the poor little ones we have known? We were told of some that they had a disease of the heart and we consoled ourselves with the thought that they could not have lived had they been rich. There were some who were consumptive. They were already coughing a great deal when they were very small. You know some who died of meningitis. Your mothers, then, would watch over your reading and tell you: Close your book, my little one, you will tire your head. Besides, it was a matter of a child too serious for his age. The people who met him sometimes did not recall having seen him laugh. We learn then that Charles Blanchard's heart did not exceed the normal dimensions and was placed in the right spot, that this child, like everyone else, only coughed from autumn onwards, and that his head was solid and could bear all the thoughts that presented themselves to it. These are qualities that take one far, they enabled Charles Blanchard to reach, in the course of the following year, the age of ten.

At ten, one is several years older than at nine. At ten one suddenly perceives that one drags behind oneself a great number of years full of errors, during which a sort of foolishness or fear that characterises the ignorant prevented us from tasting excellent things we would have loved. This is why, several times, in spring, this happened: Charles Blanchard would leave his chair, he would first half-open the door to see if the street presented no danger, then, bravely, resolutely, he would plant himself before the threshold of his house. At first, he did not feel at home, and as soon as he heard the sound of a passer-by's footsteps, he would hurry back inside. But the moment came when he felt the courage to face the passers-by, when he learned that he had nothing to fear and that he was within his rights when he installed himself in the street. One day, his mother encouraged him:

"You are right to go out a little. You are there in the shade, facing the sun, it does you good."

She ended, besides, by sending him on a few errands. This is how he went several times to fetch salt from the grocer and how another time he went, farther still, to the baker. One day, on his own initiative, he crossed the whole town to prove to himself that he was capable of doing so.

For a long time, Charles Blanchard, in the course of his outings, learned nothing at all. He simply noticed that a child can go out and that the world, as he was inclined to believe, is not inhabited by a devouring beast ready to pounce upon people who leave their house. This discovery has, besides, much more importance than one might imagine. He among us who has two legs and two eyes ends, when he is not afraid to use them, by finding himself before certain spectacles that will know how to attract and hold his attention. One need only set off, it is not even necessary to walk for long. There are several who did not need to go half the way to meet what they called life; she herself travels great distances, she passes through villages, she stops a while in each street, you will only have to take the few steps that separate you from one of them.

The small town where Charles Blanchard lived was not one of those bustling cities in which factories, shops, inns make men, women and carriages circulate in crowds and determine an activity whose spectacle leads you much more to pleasure or to work than to reflection. She was one of those small towns as one sees in the provinces of the Centre, which, surrounded by the countryside as a house by a vegetable garden, receive from it the products necessary for their subsistence and lead that existence of retired civil servants for whom it is enough to be sheltered from want. Movement there was measured, action wise and slow, the main event that stirred life and pushed it to show itself was the market which, on the square, gathered prudent housewives, able to appreciate the quality of goods and examining them with care.

THE CLOG-MAKER'S HOUSE (I)

... Such was the house of Baptiste and Rose Dumont. Its appearance was not deceiving. One ate there on the round table thick soups, after which one ate again the inexhaustible provisions the sideboard contained: beans, cabbages, potatoes and on Sunday a piece of bacon; one sometimes drank wine. One slept there in linen sheets, on a feather bed, under an overflowing eiderdown whose warmth brooded over the well-being of a satisfied body and the feelings of a contented heart. One worked there all day. The clog-maker would seize the wood, split it, cut it, hollow it, give it the shape he had chosen, then when evening fell and he had stacked his clogs, he would straighten up and with a proud eye consider life. One was free, one was happy, one was confident. Each day was followed by an easy morrow. Each morrow was followed by another. One could look before oneself at great distances, one was sheltered from all the misfortunes that time sometimes brings with it. Nothing was lacking here of what is needed for existence to be happy and long. One could procure oneself many pleasures, one had already procured some. Baptiste and Rose would have thought something was missing if they had not tasted the one that consists in having a child. They had the means to make all the expenses its upkeep requires. This is why in addition to their house, their furniture and the money the wardrobe must have contained, they possessed a child. She was a little girl of ten. They had done well. She did them honour, she had acquired all the qualities one needed to live beside them.

Her name was Cecile, she had beautiful blonde hair in a plait and the plait was tied with a blue ribbon. She went to school, she could read; in the evening, at four o'clock, when she came home, she would set her notebooks on the table and write for a long time. In the morning, she would help her mother, she would make the bed, she would dust the furniture, she would climb on a chair to wipe the mantelpiece. She would have liked to know how to cook. She rejoiced to live in the house of her parents. She had two large blue eyes which she used to see it well, then, when she had considered all its objects, she would make her reflections aloud. It seemed the house paid her back in gratitude. She would eat between meals sweet things that the house contained: sometimes it was a slice of bread and butter, sometimes bread and jam, or chocolate, or else fruit. It seemed it was to bear witness to her happiness that she was beautiful, and joyful, and greedy. She talked, she laughed, she sang, she ran among the furniture when the urge came upon her. She was happy like the room, active like the shop.

When Charles Blanchard entered his uncle's house, it was not one of those visits such as those of our relatives who have succeeded pay us once in their lives in the course of their journey to their native country. It was not necessary to wash the windows, to redden the tiles, to wax the furniture nor to change the curtains for the house to be worthy of him. It was not necessary to celebrate him with one of those abundant and recherche meals that show one places very high the habits and taste of the person one receives. When he had sat down, when that thing fatigued by the journey was set upon a chair, it was she who would have greatly needed a thorough cleaning to be worthy of the house.

His cap, his overcoat, his trousers, his stockings and down to his clogs were not yellow, were not black, were not grey, were not blue; their colour was that of those rags one has sometimes seen in the ditches of villages where the sanitation service is not well done, thrown among dead moles and pierced saucepans. His aunt, who was a woman of order, thought:

"I cannot help it. It seems to me I have not taken my sweepings out of the room."

As he was wrinkled, as he did not look at her, as he was silent, his cousin understood quickly that he was wicked. When, going from one place to another, she had to pass before him, she walked on tiptoe, for fear of waking a mysterious beast that, hidden in that malevolent body, would have snapped her up in passing. She ended by being unable to bear it, she rushed away from the danger; once in the street, she kept a certain distance between herself and the house. And a little later, as her mother, noticing her absence, went to the door to see what she could be doing, she still did not approach.

"Why don't you come in?" said Rose.

She advanced with caution, she spoke very low to say:

"I'm frightened!"

She was pale, she was trembling.

Her mother had to take her by the hand, bring her close by force, and make her touch her cousin with her finger. She drew back.

When they had to put him to bed, they had to take this double impression into account. Baptiste had had an idea such as men have. He would have liked his wife to go and share the little girl's bed, and he would have slept in his bed with the boy, but Rose was quick to put a stop to that.

"You can put him wherever you like, but I don't want him in my room. And besides, he would soon give my daughter nightmares."

Between the room and the shop there was a small space without light, which served as a lumber-room, a sort of dark closet where they put the dirty linen and the old clothes they had not yet thrown away.

Rose said:

"You just have to throw in there everything that can no longer be of use to us. I'll put my linen somewhere else. He can sleep in there."

Baptiste went to fetch from the attic an old straw mattress and a kind of mattress he had always kept, without knowing why, besides. He carried them to the place indicated. The aunt was annoyed at having to get out her sheets. In the end, she took only one: folded in two, it did the job. She placed on it an old blanket, then, when everything was installed, she approached the child who, bent double, seemed set in old age and decrepitude; she came very close and shouted in his ear as if he were deaf:

"Time for bed, grandfather!"

From the day after that, life began. For Charles Blanchard it was not the life of an apprentice, he was no longer at the point where the young man studies his trade and, each morning, discovering the difficulties, feels himself still far from the day when he will be able to practise it with ease. Who could have thought of making an apprentice of him? It seemed rather that he had long since served his apprenticeship. It seemed that he had long since trained himself in quite another thing than the trade of clog-maker. He was no longer an apprentice, he was a master. He had succeeded, besides. He had achieved his type, he was perfect in his kind. Time could only add days to his age, time could only put him on display to men for a few years more. What he was, he was well, he was with force, he was with perseverance, he offered the example of it.

THE CLOG-MAKER'S HOUSE (II)

This was called a coche, that was a chevre, here is a plot. The tools were called a paroir, a hachoir, a cuiller, a butoir, and there were others whose names one constantly forgot. One could not even have described them, for their shape was complicated and their use delicate, one had to wait for the moment when the clog-maker used them to ask him: "By the way, what is this tool called?" It was only after having seen them often and for a long time in the hands of a workman that one learned that some served to rough out, others to hollow, others to finish the clogs.

Seeing the room, one thought of the fine clothes and the white linen the wardrobe contained, one told oneself that, on the round table, in the dishes the sideboard contained, good meals must be eaten after which one would go to enjoy a deep sleep under eiderdowns whose warmth was sweet to the heart like a feeling. Seeing the shop, one envied the life of an industrious workman who, all the day long, tastes that pleasure which consists in handling instruments whose use he alone knows and which makes of him, among other men, an active and intelligent man full of great merit. Seeing the room, one told oneself that workmen's wives are happy because they lack nothing, seeing the shop one told oneself that workmen are intelligent because they know how to do everything.

The house of Baptiste and Rose Dumont also contained a little girl. This little girl was not made like all children. Her name was Cecile, she had beautiful blonde hair in a plait and the plait was tied with a blue ribbon. She talked, she sang aloud, she ran in the street when the urge came upon her. She had two large blue eyes which she used to look around her, then when she had seen what presented itself, she would make her reflections. She had her desires, she had her caprices, nearly always she was obeyed. She ate between meals, she was given sometimes a slice of bread and butter, sometimes bread and jam, or chocolate, or else fruit. She was beautiful, she was joyful, she was greedy, she lived in the house in the manner of little girls, she leaped, she laughed, one heard her warbling. She lived in the house as birds live in the woods.

There was room here for a little girl so made. She went to school, she could read; in the evening, at four o'clock, when she came home, she would set her notebooks on the table and write for a long time. At eight o'clock, after soup, it was she who put away in a cupboard the spoons, the plates and the glasses. In the morning, she helped her mother, she made the bed with her, she dusted the furniture, she climbed on a chair to wipe the mantelpiece. She joined in all the actions of daily life, she put the salt and the butter in the soup; once, under her mother's supervision, she had cooked a rabbit. There was room here for a little girl so made. She touched everything, she joined in all the work that was done in the room; her cheeks were red, her skin shining, she was cared for like the furniture. Her hands were nimble, her legs firm and straight, she went even into the shop and helped her father to stack the clogs; she was deft, she was brave, she was active, she took part in the life of a workman.

THE CLOG-MAKER'S HOUSE (III)

The house of Baptiste Dumont and his wife whose name was Rose was, in the village of Champvallon, a workman's house.

It contained two rooms. The front room was called the chamber, the back room was called the shop. In the chamber one found all that is needed to live at ease. There was even a large mirror above the mantelpiece and on each side of this mirror blue vases in which one could have put flowers. It was not here that one would have gone without a wardrobe. The wardrobe was of walnut, with double doors. There was also a sideboard, a round table and two kinds of chairs. The first were like all the rather stiff chairs of the countryside, but the second possessed a slanted back whose curved bars embraced so well the back of the person who leaned against them that it would have been useless to acquire an armchair. If there was no armchair, it was because one did not feel the need. The two beds did not look poor with their curtains, their pillows, their blankets, their eiderdown, the mouldings of their wood. They occupied a large space in the room, they were clean, swollen and important. They faced each other as in a well-fed family a man and a woman in good condition face each other. At the head of one of the beds, the one on the right, one saw a night table.

The shop contained the clog-makers' equipment and their tools which, at first sight, inspired respect. To know the names of the objects there was already a sign of superiority. This was called a coche, that was a chevre, here is a pelot. The tools were called a paroir, a hachon, a cuiller, a butoir, and there were others whose names one constantly forgot. One could not even have described them for their shape was complicated and their use delicate; one had to wait for the moment when the clog-maker used them to ask him: "By the way, what is this tool called?" It was only after having seen them often and for a long time in the hands of a workman that one learned that some served to rough out, others to hollow, others to finish the clogs.

As soon as one had crossed the threshold of Baptiste Dumont's house, one set foot in the shop. It no longer seemed then that one was in one of those villages in the centre of France that rest amid the countryside; one entered a country apart that was situated in no precise region and where there reigned the customs depicted for us in certain marvellous tales. Andersen would not have placed it in Denmark nor Canon Schmid in his Bavaria. Baptiste Dumont was a clog-maker. His house was situated in a particular country: the country of Clogs.

It contained so many that one might easily have imagined it contained them all and that one could have gone round the world afterwards without meeting a single one. They were there. Some were hung along the walls and hid them so well from view that one wondered if walls existed. Others hung from ropes stretched across the ceiling a little higher than your head, above those ropes there were others still from which a second layer of clogs was suspended, then there was a third layer no doubt, and as one could not see the ceiling, it seemed that the ceiling did not exist either and that the clogs occupied the house up to the roof. There were still others that, not having been able to find their place, scattered here and there on the floor, paved the shop and definitively gave the impression that the whole house, wall, ceiling, floor, was built of clogs.

"It is not you who made them all," one would say to Baptiste.

He would show with pride the labels which, stuck to the sole, on the inside of each of them, bore in printed characters these words:

Baptiste Dumont
clog-maker
at Champvallon

And in the middle of the shop, in a space he had kept for himself, surrounded by his equipment, his instruments and his pieces of wood, with a courage he never let diminish, he was busy making more.

Sometimes, with great blows, giving with his whole body, with the mallet and the iron wedges, he would strike the wood like a sledgehammer and succeed in splitting it. Sometimes, using the complicated tools of the trades, having taken it at the right place, with a knowing turn of the waist, with a skilful turn of the arm, he would hollow it with firmness. Later, with a difficult gesture, with a sure gesture, with other tools still, he was at the delicate part of his work and did not give a single false blow. Sometimes he had the strength, sometimes the dexterity, sometimes the precision. His posture and his very life were determined by the necessities of making clogs. Never did he stand quite straight like men who, suddenly, raise their head, abandon their occupations and look into the street wondering: Let me see, where am I, and what is happening around me? He was at such a moment of his work, the only event that could occur was this: a pair of clogs had just been roughed out. He would move on to the following operation which consisted in hollowing them. He would go from one tool to the neighbouring tool, as one goes from one friend to another, having obtained from the last all the services he could render you. He frequented them as one frequents people, needing through them to be pushed along in the world. They were called a hachon, a paroir, an asciot, a cuiller, a butoir, a rasp, a ve. He knew them well. For each of them he had the posture one must have. He took them as one must take them. Some required that he lean, he leaned; others that he bend, he bent; when he sat down, it was not to rest from his work: it was that, to use such a tool, it was necessary that he be seated. He ended, besides, by receiving his reward. The result of a well-directed effort, the crowning of a thousand delicate cares, the reward granted to a scrupulous conscience was that two perfect clogs, making the pair, had just been completed in his hands. He would examine them on both sides, he would knock them one against the other, they gave a clear and full sound, comparable to the sound a fine silver coin gives. Then he would put them away among the others. For so long they had been the object of his movements, the companions of his hours, that one would have said they partook of his life, that they had passed through his organs and that they were still warm.

Such was the shop of Baptiste Dumont. Clogs have a first odour which is that of their wood. The shop had that bitter odour still vivid of freshly cut wood that the newly made clogs gave it, but it also had that wiser odour as if resigned of well-dried clogs that makes you think that trees after their death keep and that one might call an odour of sanctity. Clogs are made from walnut wood. The shop smelt of leaf, smelt of walnut, smelt of mould. An intimate and discreet atmosphere was hers, as if the walnut trees before disappearing had confided to the quarters that were to be drawn from their branches some memory gentle and almost extinguished. But that was very little. One may say that clogs have another odour. Clogs recall the clog-maker. What one breathed above all in the shop was the odour of his virtues. They were made of courage, of perseverance, of a great feeling of assurance, and amid those provincial days that are crossed by no noisy event, one would have said they unfolded all along the hours until evening, then when evening fell after a long time, they seemed to fill the house. The clog-maker worked with such simplicity and devoted with so natural a feeling his whole life to his clogs that one understood at once that there existed a way of living that gave calm, balance and assurance.

The shop was full of this truth, it was full of truth. One practised a trade there because one must practise a trade. It was here a particular case: that of the trade of clog-maker, but from the shop came a broader teaching: that one worked there because man must work. It must be said that the shop smelt of good air, that it smelt of truth, that it smelt of health, that some gentle stir in its atmosphere brought you an odour of perfect life and gave you to think that you were made for it.

... And now we have left the widow's house, where, delivered over to time as a man to an endless illness, life, waiting for it to finish her, had lain down far from the light. We are going to leave behind us, and may we not recognise them if later we pass again through the places they occupied then, the feelings she heaped up so as to have a whole world to oppose to ours, so that her misfortune might be greater than our joy. We have left the widow's house. We shall no longer walk on the roads that, starting from her door, led us into countrysides at the end of which the farms were situated so far from inhabited places that one dared many things there. We shall no longer follow the road home, when a woman and her son were no longer, the one a child, the other his mother, but in the human species two creatures declassed and plunged in beggary up to their necks. We are going to forget the winter that, seated on the other side of the fireplace like an old man of a hundred years, had lived beside the poor during days so long that it seemed they had reached his age.

We shall not however leave the little boy who, in the midst of a desolate life, had embraced silence as a career and who, having abandoned all that was not himself, seemed to wish to plunge his destiny into the bottomless waters of a mortal solitude. We shall not stop here the book of his life, and as in romantic times, when tears were loved, we shall not accept his young despair, and we shall not entitle the truthful account of his first years: History of Charles Blanchard, the Child of Misfortune. We wish to hear the sound of his voice. We shall have the patience to wait for long days still, very bitter no doubt, to make him forget a little of his woes. We shall have faith in the joy of living, we shall hope that it will rejoin those who had strayed from it or those from whom it had strayed. May we meet it at the end of these pages! Wait still: it is someone who knows it who begs you. The blind have seen, more than one has heard, who no longer even wished to listen, and the child who for so long has been silent, wait a little: what if he were to speak to your ears, in a voice as clear as yours, and by the road of deliverance lead you into a country you knew poorly before he had shown it to you. What if we were to entitle this book: History of Charles Blanchard, the Laughing Young Man!*

It is not necessary to describe point by point, as had to be done when he lived with his mother, the life into which Charles Blanchard was drawn during the first days he spent with his uncle. We shall not make, as is ordinarily done in books, a portrait of Baptiste and Rose Dumont surrounded in their interior by all those objects and all that furniture amid which married people are at home and which, in households where there are no children, receive the care these would have received. Still less shall we go back to the village of Champvallon to see their house from a little higher and better place, among those of other men, their tastes, their habits and their labours. We shall not ask them for a detailed account of each of their daily actions. At what time did they rise? To what task did they devote the first part of their day? Of what foods was the menu of their meals composed? And in those provincial afternoons whose hours beneath a dull sky hang like enormous cumbersome bunches of grapes, with what gesture did they pluck, one after another, heavy minutes? We shall not study the curtains and the mattress of the bed in which they put their nephew to sleep.

It was not their words Charles Blanchard heard, it was not in this bed rather than another that he lay down in the evening, it was not in rainy or sunny afternoons that he lived. When he ate cabbages, beans or potatoes, did he know what he was eating? Do daily actions exist for him? If he made a few gestures since he was not dead, one may say it was solely because of that. He did not contract habits, he did not acquire new tastes. It was not Champvallon he lived in. He did not see a single piece of the house's furniture.

As regards the particular case of Baptiste, we have no need to furnish a precise description of this man, and drawing him with a clear line, to distinguish him from Jacques or Thomas, clog-makers like him. We have no need, in painting a character, to attain that perfection which means that if he passed near you in the street, you would be able to recognise him among three thousand other passers-by. It was barely necessary to say, to fix a few details, what his trade was, and it was solely for the convenience of the narrative that he had to be called by his name.

It was not beside a man of forty-five, with a beard already grey and wearing an imperial, somewhat stooped because clog-makers, to have more strength in their arms, give blows with the shoulder, it was not beside his uncle Baptiste Dumont who, in 1869, when he was a soldier, fighting in the Italian campaign, had received a bullet in the thigh at Solferino, that Charles Blanchard lived during the first days of his apprenticeship.

One would have said he lived beside a dragon. What monstrous beast, pouncing upon him suddenly, when he lived in his mother's house, had in a single blow devoured the thoughts that in a place for which he was made, he had taken twelve years to form? One would have said it had carried him off through the air. Where then had it set him down? It did not leave him. It seemed it had installed itself in the middle of the door, to guard every exit, and that it sent him full in the head the implacable feeling of its presence. The beast of labour that feeds on the flesh and blood of men and that, the better to bring them to the point, seizes them when they are still children, had taken this one with fury. He lived beside it.

At first, Charles Blanchard could not get used to the shop. It was useless to leave him there during entire days and to watch him so that he would not escape, he still could not get used to it. It seemed he had been taken out of his natural element and plunged into another element for which he was not made. He choked at first like a man who has just fallen into water. His body had lost its weight, his feet their support, death surrounded his chest; with his two arms, he tried to keep it at a distance.

When he calmed down, the first surprise past, he was not yet where he thought he was. It now seemed he had been plunged into an incandescent atmosphere. To breathe the air of the shop was a task he would have wished not to have to accomplish. He went about it in several attempts, he tried to stop in its passage a flood of burning gas that rushed into his throat. He could not manage it. One might have believed that in his chest a whole enemy army, having entered by force, was burning a vanquished people upon enormous pyres. He felt full of blood and full of fire, and throughout the extent of his lungs, there was a series of explosions, as if the fire, reaching into the depths, had reached, as in a city, the secret reserves where the powder is buried. He coughed as one explodes.

These were dreadful days. He surrounded with his two arms, to protect it, the poor creature that he was. He clothed himself in himself as a woman covers with a great embrace her sick child. It was worse still. He felt the pain stir beneath the hand he pressed upon it. He coughed, he coughed it. One could hear that cough. It made one think of those vain barkings that dogs address to the moon that threatens them, or, better still, of those great cries by which the dying, on their beds of agony, hope to awaken the pity of their god.

His eyes hurt. The shop had a vast window and drew its light directly from the sky. A great white daylight with which it was filled possessed it entirely, and between the four walls, occupying even the corners, a vigorous daylight with authority forced you to live under its law. It made one think of the sun itself, and, with its implacable arrow, full in the pupils, reached the child with such force that it was to be feared it would go through his head. He felt its burning as far as his nape. To close his eyes was not enough. He had two thin and transparent eyelids, he would have needed eyelids of lead. He had lived until then in the dark room of Solange's house, it was night his eyes had received there, it was in shadow his body had developed, and whoever through his flabby flesh could have glimpsed its organs would no doubt have found them full of some matter such as one sees in cellars, whitish, soft and mouldy. His eyes hurt. Two inflamed eyelids veiled an eye raw and like some bloody ball. His eyes hurt more than hurt, for it seemed that the light, penetrating through them into the mysterious depths of his flesh, had reached the strange growths of the shadow. Disturbing fermentations swelled him, a swarming in his entrails was horrible and accompanied by a dull noise one could not bear and which made his aunt, turning towards him, sometimes shout at him angrily:

"Be quiet!"

For a long time he suffered from an intestinal disorder.

Scarcely four days had passed when one might already wonder, as after the twelve years of his childhood, that he was not dead. One could not write the strange dialogue of the elements that, leagued against a child, were trying their power upon him.

The air said:

"I choke him."

And the light:

"I dissolve him."

Another comrade came to their aid.

Charles Blanchard was scarcely beaten down when a new companion was already seizing him and wished in his turn to try his strength. He came to know labour.

Charles Blanchard did not know what labour is. He quickly believed his uncle was mad. But how then did this man live? When he could have spent the days on his chair, he would get up, without one being able to imagine the cause. He was standing. The child was already examining him with distrust, but soon, when, seizing in his full hand one of the tools that surrounded him, Baptiste would examine its edge before using it, Charles Blanchard understood that he must not lose sight of him and that it was time to be on his guard.

. . . . . . . . . . . .

Many days were needed for him to have driven out death, more time was needed than one could believe. It was necessary that he transform himself drop by drop, that the poor blood that was his renew itself entirely. Medicine teaches us that it takes three years for a human body to modify its substance completely. For three years Charles Blanchard was still to feel misery within him.

He had not, besides, cause to rejoice during the first weeks of his recovery. Certainly, he was better. Past the first disorders of a sudden revolution, a peace somewhat sad no doubt had established itself in his body, one would have said he bore more than one mourning; but in the deep layers one was beginning to accept life already, such as circumstances imposed. The air of the shop was received without protest by submissive lungs. The light was accepted as a necessary evil. Certainly, he breathed, he was beginning to look around him at a world that no longer had that gesture of leaping at his eyes. But it was then that an enemy he had not had the leisure to think of until now advanced at his hour, and with that assurance that the feeling of royalty gives a king, presented himself straight before the child. Charles Blanchard had to learn to know labour.

<p class="scene-break">· · ·</p>

The first labour Charles Blanchard undertook was accomplished in the following circumstances: The quarters of wood Baptiste used were piled to his left, within reach of his hand; one of them having fallen very close to his leg was going to hamper him in his movements. He addressed the child to say to him:

"Pick up this piece of wood for me and put it with the others."

Then as he had not had to be asked twice to accomplish this task, Baptiste showed him some clogs which, along the wall, on the floor, were lined up and said to him:

"Look at these clogs, they are not finished. This evening, when I have a moment, you will have to rasp them."

In the afternoon, Baptiste had a moment. To rasp clogs, one need only place them, set them on one's knees, take in both hands the instrument called a rasp and use it. Charles Blanchard, the first day, rasped four pairs of clogs without difficulty.

The next day, Baptiste had him blacken them. For this one uses, as a brush, a hare's foot that one dips in a black dye. It is an amusing task in the course of which one does not practise the trade of clog-maker, but another much finer: that of painter.

That was not all, besides, for a little later, Baptiste having to split his wood had driven in the iron wedges that must penetrate its mass. He was going to seize his mallet when he had an idea. He called his nephew to say to him:

"Take the mallet by the handle and strike as hard as you can on the wedges. We shall see your strength."

Labour lies in wait for men and awaits them at each of the moments of their rest. It had been enough that Charles Blanchard was obliged to remain in the shop. Labour at first put on some ceremony and approached him in the early days as if it had only wished to distract him, or else as if it had wished to be forgiven the unfortunate impression it had at first sight produced on him. Labour wished only his happiness. It even left him when it had gone a proud satisfaction.

"You see, you know how to do such a thing. You have rasped, you have blackened clogs. You know how to work now."

And for what the child did not yet know how to do, it prepared it for him like a delicate surprise.

"It will be better still when you can split wood like your uncle."

VARIANTS OF THE OTHER VERSIONS

... He learned at once that the stomach is in man the essential organ, that by which he rises to the highest degree and reigns over all humanity with glory. And how powerful Charles Blanchard's stomach was! It seemed to him he could have eaten the vegetables as they were, all raw. He would have eaten the cabbages, he would have eaten the turnips, he did not know what tomatoes were, he did not wonder, although he was delicate, if he could get used to their taste: he would have made but one mouthful of them! He would have plunged his head into a basket of pears; he would have bitten, he would have chewed, he would have swallowed, he would have gone on to the next basket. Nothing would have stopped him: not the spinach, not the salad, not the carrots; he who did not like cheese would sometimes turn around to face the row of cheeses and he would have eaten whole cheeses. All that the Market Square contained would scarcely have satisfied his appetite.

When he was on the Market Square, Charles Blanchard could not bring himself to leave. At most he would happen to move away from the vegetables and fruits to take a turn on the side of the poultry, but he did not possess very clear notions about meat, and moreover that of geese, hens and ducks was covered and hidden by feathers that had nothing tempting. He would quickly return to the spot he had left, not without having in passing given a glance at the pats of butter. He would have bet he could eat one without bread. But here are the first baskets of fruits and vegetables: it seemed to him he was returning to his homeland. He would approach them; when no one was looking, he would touch them a little with his hand that he swung, as if carelessly. He would walk, all surrounded by cherished friends, he would recognise them, he would send them his affection. Willingly he would have said to them: It is I, do you feel that I am here! Certainly he could not bring himself to leave. One does not know what he was waiting for. He was waiting for something: for an apple of its own accord to come into his mouth, for the peaches and grapes to begin walking at his side, for the old world to be set in motion, for Heaven and Earth to merge, for a revolution to occur suddenly; and he must not go away, for great events might happen during his absence.

THE WOODEN HORSES (I)

... There was more still, not all of it happened in his head. Towards four o'clock in the afternoon, the people who until then had had business, those who are always late, the girls who had gone to the dance to do a turn, the last inhabitants of the small town in a word, with the children, with the friends, with the people they had met on the way, came around the merry-go-round of wooden horses to take the place each has the right to occupy. They advanced, as people advance, with the need to go to the front row. A fairly large movement resulted from this, a surge as when new generations, pushing aside what hampers them, wish to make their place in the sun. It was then a matter of holding fast so that they could not dislodge you from the post you had long before them conquered. No one failed to do so. One even heard the sound of a few quarrels.

Charles Blanchard knew a feeling he had not yet experienced. Perhaps it would be fitting to call it respect or submission to destiny. Perhaps these words do not express it enough still. It was not before numbers, it was not before strength that he yielded. He could, besides, have taken advantage of the push that was given him, and, advancing a few steps, carried by the crowd, occupied the front row without even having done it on purpose. He was careful not to. He saw these ones coming, he saw those ones coming; they advanced with assurance, he felt that a great difference existed between them and him; with an attentive eye, before even they had settled in, he considered the spot they seemed to wish to choose. When they approached it, he would move aside obediently, abandon the ground to them and go a few steps further, into a corner, to take the place they had been good enough to leave him.

What could be foreseen even happened. Which is that before the growing crowd, from here to over there, then elsewhere still, settling successively everywhere there was no one whose place he could take, the moment came when he had but one single refuge, near a wall, there where a man even would not have wished to stay, for fear of being crushed. This last refuge was finally forbidden him when a band of young peasants who had drunk a little came and planted themselves in front of him.

Charles Blanchard then occupied the place destiny had assigned him. He did not struggle. At no moment did it come to his mind that he could have fought as the others fought, and playing with elbows, head and knees, brought down in the human wall what was needed to let his body through. From the first blow, he was a vanquished one. So it was. In the thickness of the mass, not a crack, not a fissure, not a hole, the row of spectators held its post with the firmness of old soldiers guarding their country. It was not a matter of grieving over it, it was not a matter of wishing it were otherwise. So it was. The child would step back a few paces. He would cross his two small hands on his belly, and, legs apart, head straight, he would plant himself with solidity and occupy the place that had been assigned him. He would blink his eyelids, he would breathe, he would live, he would think. When he was weary of having crossed his hands on his belly, he would cross them behind his back. He occupied the last place with naturalness. He had two blue eyes, those eyes of children that are larger than those of men because they have not yet seen anything and they need to see many things. He contemplated the spectacle he was permitted to contemplate. The backs of the men were thick because many wore smocks, the skirts of the women were ample, there were no small children, because their mothers placed them in the front row. Sometimes a broad wave, a surge of pleasure rushing from a corner would seize them all. The laughter of people enjoying themselves passed from each to each, one could see it circulate, it shook the shoulders of the men, it seemed that from one to another they passed it on, no one let it fall. Around the wooden horses it was an afternoon of gaiety. In the sky there was what was needed of clouds so that one might be in the shade everywhere. One abandoned oneself to the fine weather, one abandoned oneself to the wooden horses, to the day of the fair. In broad sheets, it seemed that happiness fell from the azure and spread over men some luminous joy in which they stood.

THE WOODEN HORSES (II)

After a moment, his mother came to see him. She touched his shoulder, he turned round; it was only she! She had given a sideways glance at the wooden horses. One does not know if it was them she had seen, perhaps she had noticed only a band of wooden beasts whose mixture, drawn into a great circular movement, turned with garish colours around a sort of gaiety that was neither of her age nor of her condition. She leaned over the child, she told him all she knew:

"Come now, my little one, you can see that they are made of wood."

He did not answer. It was not true that the wooden horses were made of wood. The wooden horses were red, were green, were yellow. They did not resemble those wooden horses with which children play and then abandon anywhere, in a corner. They were more beautiful than the horses one knows, they had the real size, the size those should have so that one could mount upon their backs. Charles Blanchard was seven years old, he was at a very particular point in his life. He did not perhaps believe, but he willingly imagined that the wooden horses were beasts from another country that had been brought together and that walked one after another to make turn a beautiful merry-go-round, a beautiful gilded palace.

He did not even need resignation. The poor have received the grace of God.

He had that surprise one feels when one perceives that the truth is so simple. From the first blow his heart was made for it. It had few transformations to make when it settled there. A crowd of feelings, of themselves, grouped around it.

Truly, the merry-go-round of wooden horses was too beautiful for Charles Blanchard. It contained all the things one did not see at his home. In the morning the child had noticed only the horses. It contained other things still. One sees there mirrors, oriflammes, hangings, artificial flowers, fringes. The colours were dazzling, it would have been difficult to say if the merry-go-round was red or if it was gilded. The organ made one think of pianos.

Once, through the open window, the child had glimpsed the drawing room of Madame Leon Bonnet who was a very rich woman. There was a column lamp and double silk curtains. The merry-go-round made one think of that drawing room. The merry-go-round was comparable to palaces, the merry-go-round was comparable to drawing rooms one glimpses only through the window. Charles Blanchard had never set foot there, he would never have dared set foot there. He knew he was not made to cross their threshold.

There is then something singular to add. If someone at that moment had given him a sou, Charles Blanchard would not have believed he possessed what was needed to be admitted to mount the wooden horses.

Certainly, he went back to see them since they were there. Children cannot help going to see what exists. Perhaps he walked more slowly than he had done in the morning. No matter! He set off nevertheless. There was a merry-go-round of wooden horses in the town. Charles Blanchard had been created and brought into the world to contemplate it.

He noticed at once, besides, that he had been rather bold until then. He had rather considered the wooden horses as his property. He had run during a turn beside a great red horse that was the one he preferred, and he had touched it on the leg. And between two turns, when there are enough of those who descend to embarrass those who mount, he had mingled with the crowd of people who had the right to approach the merry-go-round.

THE WOODEN HORSES (III)

He was seven years old, he was at a very particular point in his life. He did not perhaps believe, but he willingly imagined that the merry-go-round was a great living creature with six mirrors at its centre, and that made beasts turn around its six mirrors. It was scarcely a pleasure for him. There was something to know here, there was a secret of nature to surprise. He watched the people, they were grouped by twos, by threes, by families, by masses, each horse had its rider. It was a matter of a thing worth taking an interest in. Men, women, children, no one uttered a word, each closed their eyes a little, each had seized the bridle of their mount; and with a serious air, with an attentive air, for this is how it happens in villages, they abandoned themselves to a happiness full of music. They seemed possessed entirely by a mystery whose revelation would never reach Charles Blanchard. A turn of wooden horses lasted three minutes. At the end of three minutes everyone descended. There were some who then took out their handkerchief and wiped their lips as when one has eaten with a full mouth.

At no moment did it come to his mind that he could have been in their place. He did not envy them. There is even something singular to say: Perhaps he no longer imagined that with a sou in hand he would have possessed what was needed to have a turn on the wooden horses. He watched attentively. He saw there children with whom he had played. Never had he seen them so well. They were not, as he had believed, his fellows. Their clothes were beautiful, their hands, their heads, their gestures, everything showed him that until now he had been mistaken about them. They had with the wooden horses a freedom that made you think they were accustomed to living with them. Sometimes they would sit backwards, and their faces turned towards the croup of their horse, they were deft, they were joyful, and behaved with pleasure as if they had long been its familiars. Other times they would sit like women. They could have fallen, but they did not fall; everywhere, in all positions, they were at ease, they seemed to have been created to mount the wooden horses. He contemplated their faces. Their eyes were not made like his, their cheeks were finer, their noses delicate, he could not take his gaze from them. Their heads held straight above their shoulders; if they gave you a glance, they gave it you from somewhat above. They were grave, simple in happiness, they resembled the rich one sees only in carriages, a word from them would have been a cause of pride for you. They were the masters, they were the warriors, they would have been those who command us. They looked noble.

THE WOODEN HORSES (IV)

... Those who mounted the wooden horses, besides, were not made in his image. He watched them attentively. Never had he seen them so well. There were children there with whom he had played. Until now he had been mistaken about them. Their clothes were beautiful, their hands, their heads, their gestures, everything showed him that until now he had been mistaken about them. He did not envy them, he admired them. Sometimes they did not mount in the way everyone else did, they would sit backwards, and their faces turned towards the croup of their mount, they were deft, they were joyful. They could have fallen, but they did not fall. Everywhere, in all positions, they were at ease, they seemed to have been created to mount the wooden horses. They lived, they went, they circulated among things in the midst of which Charles Blanchard felt he would have been lost. He contemplated their faces. Their eyes did not seem to him made like his. Their cheeks were finer, their noses delicate. He could not take his gaze from them. Their heads held straight above their shoulders; if they gave him a glance, they gave it him from somewhat above. He would not have dared speak to them. They were the masters; they were those who command us, none could be compared to them. They looked noble.

Perhaps one should use a terrible comparison. Charles Blanchard knew a feeling such as dogs know. He stayed here, because he had to be somewhere, but he stayed there gently, with timidity, and, his two arms pressed along his body, his legs aligned, his head a little low, so as not to take too much space, even in height, he diminished and lessened his presence. It was a feeling such as dogs know who possess no property in the sun and everywhere feel themselves in the property of others. He did everything he had to so that he would not be chased from it. He did not wait for people to have chosen their place; from as far as he saw them coming, he would move aside and offer them his. He was afraid of bothering those who were in front of him. Sometimes, for no reason, he would step back a few paces. Other times, however, he had a reason. Someone, without even seeing him, had cast a glance in his direction.
