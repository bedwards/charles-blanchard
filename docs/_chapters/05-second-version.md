SECOND VERSION

Charles Blanchard, whose story I undertake today to tell you, showed during the first ten years of his life no virtue, no particular genius that might have set him apart from other children. He never differed from what you were, he went where you have gone, his eyes resembled yours, he saw what you have seen, and as for the events through which he passed, you have heard their telling from the mouths of those who attended your own beginnings in this world. I have, then, in commencing this book, but one word to say to you: There existed, in a small provincial town, a child of ten years who was called Charles Blanchard.

Destiny might have maintained him until the age of thirteen in what we call the state of innocence, if one day, the week of the patron saint's festival, which was celebrated each year on the Sunday following the feast of Saint John, an astonishing piece of news had not spread through the town:

"They say that this time, for the festival, we shall have the wooden horses."

Everything came to pass as had been announced: there were the wooden horses.

They were not known then as they are today. My story begins in 1849. Only one small boy, who had an uncle working in the factories at Montlucon, having gone to stay with him for some time the year before, had found himself there at the moment of the festival and had seen a carousel of wooden horses.

His explanations were no doubt not very clear, for when the great day arrived, his companions had retained from his speeches but a single point: that they were going to see something beautiful. They were all surprised, one as much as the other; and even the one who had seen them the year before, at the moment when the canvas surrounding the wooden horses was removed, at eleven o'clock, after high mass, stood a good five minutes before he could form a clear idea of what he beheld.

There they were, all in a circle, one following upon another. There were red ones, there were yellow ones, there were green ones. They were fitted with two stirrups, a tail, a bridle. Their four legs had the form of horses. They turned to the sound of a gilded organ, and above them one could see perhaps hundreds of red streamers with silver fringes. It was by watching them for a long time that one made acquaintance with great marvels. Their eyes resembled real eyes: only the lashes were wanting. Those in the front rank were rearing, and their forelegs were raised a little higher than their hind legs. These wooden horses of the front rank were wooden horses at the gallop. At the centre of the carousel, a real horse, a great white horse, walked around a sort of column formed of six mirrors, in which one saw passing once more what one had already seen.

At first glance, the children were too surprised to realize what pleasure one might draw from this, and they contemplated a spectacle so beautiful that it might have been compared to the masterworks of art, which have little practical use and serve only to elevate our souls. There was nothing to do but look, and so they did not wish to lose a single glance.

After a time, more than one could not keep his happiness to himself. Charles Blanchard ran to his mother:

"Mama, I have seen the wooden horses."

She answered:

"Go and see them again then, my little one, it will help you pass the time."

That afternoon, he became entirely familiar with them. Toward half past two, in the families, when the midday meal was finished, the father, the mother, the children, the relations from the neighbouring villages who had come to attend the festival, everyone left the houses. The wooden horses had shortened the lunch, had halted the conversations, and had taken the place of those glasses of brandy that the men, their elbows on the table, would drink until evening on the day of the festival during the years that had preceded this one. One might say that the wooden horses had transformed the customs. Around them one saw the whole small town gathered, the whole small town attentive; a great joy was what she had found, and before her eyes the horses, one after another, with all their colours, with their bridles, their tails, their stirrups, filed past, carried along by an organ whose voice, dominating all sounds, spread around her a life so imperious that the mothers themselves could not stay in place and, followed by their children, rushed forward to obey it. There was, at a certain moment, a great burst of laughter in the crowd, because an old peasant, who must have been a good sixty years old, straddled a little horse, his two legs dangling, and said:

"By my faith, I want to ride like the others."

To take a turn one paid a sou.

Everyone took a turn. In this great village where life, with an even gesture, bound the days together as one binds a sheaf, gathered them, heaped them one upon another, formed of them a year as one forms a haystack, it seemed that time had abandoned his monotonous occupation, that a joyful day, thrusting aside the ordinary days, had descended upon the Earth to the sound of music; one saw him, one ran toward him, one seized him while he was there.

"This year, for the festival, we have the wooden horses."

Each one wished to take his share of it. They gleamed, they sang, they turned; one did not know quite what turned with them. It seemed that the old world could no longer stay in place and that the Sky and the Earth had begun to turn. One forgot all the rest. One was no longer the carpenter, nor the wheelwright; one had dropped one's trade, one was one of the cavaliers of pleasure; a great movement tore you from yourself, you traversed space, mounted on a fine steed.

Charles Blanchard was not long before going to find his mother. She was one of those women who, on the day of the festival, close their doors tight and sit in a dark corner of the house, the better to prove to themselves that nothing could tear them from their sad destiny. It had been two years already since she had lost her husband.

The child arrived. He put just one foot into the room; he had left the door wide open, he had not closed it because he had no time to lose.

She began by looking at him. For one second only, he had stopped. He had two blue eyes, his gaze seemed to repeat his words and his legs were preparing the movement that would carry him to the wooden horses. She said first:

"Close the door, my little one."

He closed it; they were face to face. He was already advancing.

"You would like to take a turn on the wooden horses?"

He answered very quickly:

"Mama, it costs a sou. Do you want me to take a turn on the wooden horses?"

She had stayed at home and, the door and the window being closed, believed herself sheltered. She knew that festivals furnish us one more occasion to think of all that we lack. She learned that festivals come toward us when we do not go toward them.

"My poor little one, go!"

She was not a violent woman. She might have flown into anger and tried to impose her will upon him. No. She might have disparaged the value of the game of wooden horses. She did not do that either. The truth is the best weapon of the poor. She made use of it.

"If I gave you a sou to ride the wooden horses, we should want for it tomorrow. I need it to buy us something to eat. You do want to eat tomorrow, my Charles?"

He did not know at first what he should answer. He corrected the movement of his legs, aligned them obediently; he was embarrassed on account of his hands; he had just heard, he had just received such words that he did not know how to hold himself so as to manage to bear them. His mouth opened, an empty mouth that no longer contained a single word. After a moment, he turned around. If he was able to walk, it was because he knew very well how to walk.

At that time, the poor were not what they are today. They could not read, they had never left their village, they were not mixed up in public affairs, they did not know that they were anything other than the poor. Poverty sat down beside them in the morning like the only companion; they received her, she was their life, she was their soul, they had accepted her. They were her submissive sons, she placed her two hands upon their heads, their heads were between her two hands.

One must not be surprised if Charles Blanchard did not say to his mother:

"I want to ride the wooden horses, I want to ride them!"

Charles Blanchard, quite simply, returned to his world, he became part of what we might call his class, for the classes were quite separate in 1849. Until the age of ten, he had been, in a very general way, a child. He was scarcely yet the little Charles; he was not yet the son of the widow Blanchard. He became so the day he saw the carousel of wooden horses.

When he returned that evening, a new life was beginning. His house was his house as it had never been before. From far off, he advanced with great steps. He drew near to her at last, she contained a thick shadow into which he was already penetrating. She stood a little apart from the town. One would have said that she too feared to mingle with the other houses. There they were, several of them, in the last street on the right, going up. Why were they called the New Houses? There were five of them, one beside another, capped with a very low thatch roof. They formed a single group and made one think of five old women who had seated themselves at the corner of the road and who had pulled down their hoods over their eyes because they were no longer interested in what might pass before them.

The last one was the house of Charles Blanchard. The door was large, but it was of wood; certainly the window was transparent, but truly it was lost in the wall, a square window that passers-by remarked upon, for it was ridiculous that it should be so small. Perhaps one must praise those who had the houses of the poor built for having understood that the light would serve them only to see their poverty clearly. One cannot say whether it was the roof that had raised its head or the walls that had bent their shoulders: the house was misshapen, was a little broken. It seemed that she had laboured long beneath the sky. One opened the door, one entered the room as one enters the soul of an old man. Of a whole life one saw only the remains. There was a bed, a table, four chairs and the bread-bin, just what is needed for a house not to be an uninhabited barn. There was also a clock that they had not been able to sell, it beat like a pulse and counted the hours since hours existed upon the earth.

These houses are inhabited by people who resemble them.

Solange Blanchard was no longer young, being past forty, her appearance made one think of the happiness that will not return. Her cheeks were already marked by age; beneath sorrow their flesh had given way, they had no more changes to undergo: at the first blow they had yielded, they had hollowed themselves as have the cheeks of women of sixty. Her eyes were full of a clear water, it seemed that it rose from her heart; and for nothing, for a thought, for a regret, for a feeling that passes, they shed tears by a natural virtue. Her eyes were made for weeping.

She spoke sometimes, she said then:

"My poor Charles, you are not happy."

She said again:

"As for me, it does not matter, at my age. I have not much more to expect."

She left in the morning at seven o'clock to go and help Madame Menard, the tax-collector's wife, to do her housework and dress her children. She was finished at nine o'clock, and she went then to Monsieur Lhotte's, the clerk of the justice of the peace, where there was a sitting room, a stable, a garden, and where the work was considerable. On Saturday in particular, she was never finished before noon. She returned home afterwards. Her own housework gave her little trouble, she had already finished it in the morning at the moment of her departure.

There remained to her then nothing more, all the long afternoon, than to regret having nothing more to do for the rest of the day. Madame Menard gave her three francs every month, Monsieur Lhotte gave her four francs. She would have needed a third household. The poor would always need one more person to be able to have what is necessary to them. She sat down. For a long time she had chosen her place. There were two places where she might have settled, at each of the corners of the fireplace. The one on the right was near the window, the one on the left was near the bed. She had never wished to place herself near the window. She made no gesture, she had not, like certain persons, taken up the habit of talking to herself, she did not think to pray to God, although she was very pious; God had made her poor, it seemed to her that this was his answer to ancient prayers. She thought of her unhappiness, she was very sad, sometimes she heaved a sigh so that God might hear her, so that he might understand how much she suffered, and so that he might grow weary of it.

In the evening at six o'clock she prepared the soup. At eight o'clock she undressed to go to bed. She cast a glance then at her skirt and her bodice which might have holes. They had, the one and the other, the same colour. She possessed two bodices and two skirts. She was quite wrong to mend them with black wool, she would have needed to find a particular wool of a somewhat dirty yellow, a wool that had long received the mud, the rain and the sun.

It was in this place, it was beside this woman that Charles Blanchard came to take refuge. He made no great noise. His entrance does not count among the entrances of kings. He took a chair, he sat down. He crossed his two small hands upon his legs, he became very gentle. One might have noticed that he had two blue eyes, those wide-open eyes of children into which it seems that all they see enters through doors flung wide.

His return was comparable to that of the prodigal son. During all the years of his early childhood, he had left, he had abandoned this house. He set off each morning. The vast universe was his dwelling. The sky, the sun, the meadows, the birds, the trees, the animals, all were a friend to him, all were a companion to him. He lived in the brotherhood of things with his body and his soul, he frequented all that one encounters and spent his youth dancing with the fools. He came back after the misfortunes and the disillusionments; he had asked too much of them: the earth and the skies were driving him away; along the road, from each house, a voice emerged that cried to him: "Go away!" It was no longer a matter of wooden horses. It seemed to him that the whole world had forbidden him its threshold. He returned home. He limited the world to the four walls of his room, he sat down in the middle, and the lesson that the dwellings of the poor teach, that was the one from which he would draw his profit. He was obedient and docile. He was like those studious children who go to school, who know nothing of human knowledge and wish to devote their efforts to acquiring it.

Charles Blanchard was not long in making acquaintance with someone who was to take the greatest importance in his life. He had known for a long time that men have a friend who each evening is awaited with impatience and gives to life when he arrives a taste so pure, a taste so fresh that it seems then that one has nothing more to desire. His hour comes when the day is done. He enters. Each one advances to receive him well, each one welcomes him, each one thanks him for this time again for not having failed them. All falls silent, all life is suspended from his, an angel accompanies him, the family circle forms around him. Now that he is there, the father, the mother, the children, each one can look at his neighbour and say: "The day has been hard, but now we rest with good heart." May heaven grant that he come again tomorrow! Charles Blanchard was not long in making acquaintance with someone whose value one better appreciates if he fails you. He is called the Bread.

The bread of Solange Blanchard did not resemble the bread of everyone. The bread of everyone costs four sous the pound and comes from the baker. It would be right to believe, so fine and tender is it, that one must call it by another name than that which one gives to bread. She had no trouble doing without it, for it resembled those cakes in which butter has been put and of which she knew well it was not permitted her to make her ordinary nourishment.

Every Saturday she bought nine pounds of flour. The sack that contained it, she wrapped in her apron, for fear it might be pierced. She moistened the flour, she mixed it with a little leaven, she kneaded the dough that she thus obtained. Perhaps she did not understand it as well as the baker; no matter, she formed of it a block which, returning from the oven, could nourish her for the whole week. She even added to the flour a little bran, and she was very pleased with it. Bran does not give a bad taste, it is nourishing since it serves to fatten the animals, and finally it has its weight and permits one with nine pounds of flour to obtain a loaf that would give ten pounds at the weighing.

The first days, the bread of Solange Blanchard was black and pasty. It stuck to the palate, it required a certain strength and a certain skill to get it to pass, as they say, through the strait and be willing to go where bread goes, into your stomach. When one had swallowed it one received one's reward, each mouthful added itself to the other, one felt the volume of the bread, one could appreciate its weight, there was no denying that it was there. One said: "This time it is done, I have eaten bread!" There was even reason to fear it might choke you. But from the third day on it underwent certain transformations. It did not become hard as one might have believed, the phenomenon that occurred was of a somewhat different order. It became dry first of all, then it seemed that the flour wished to reclaim its rights, the pasty mass disintegrated, each crumb crumbled in its turn, one obtained a sort of sand, one had to spend much saliva to agglutinate the grains. Toward the sixth day the bread was an ash that could only be made to pass with great gulps of water.

Such as it was, however, Solange Blanchard had for her bread a veneration, a particular devotion. Charles Blanchard ate as children eat, occupied with all the thoughts that came into his head. He let his gaze wander around him, he hummed while chewing, he got up and made the circuit of the table. His mother called him to order:

"Pay attention to your piece of bread, my little one."

He would have let it escape from his hand. Sometimes, in the famous period of the fourth, fifth and sixth days, when the crumb of which we have spoken no longer adhered to the crust except by a sort of habit and would have spread over the floor like sand that nothing holds any longer, she said to him:

"One puts one's hand beneath one's piece of bread when one eats. You can see that the crumbs are going to fall on the ground."

And when, as they say, his eyes had been bigger than his belly and he could not finish the slice of bread that his mother had cut for him, she piously gathered the fragment that the child had not eaten and put it away with care so that he might find it again the following day.

Toward the end of the week, she came to say words such as mothers do not say:

"Do not force yourself to eat, my little boy!"

She behaved toward bread as the saints behave toward their souls. They keep it whole for the use of God. They know that the wind could scatter it, that a mouse would make its nourishment of it, they know that all that is good, that all that is right, that all that counts in their hearts must be shut away with care. They know that the spirit of evil prowls and that he is greedy. Besides, it is a matter of their eternal salvation.

A superstitious terror took hold of her sometimes. She wrapped her bread in a napkin, she took great care when she unfolded it that a piece of crumb, a piece of crust, which might by chance have come loose, should not escape and fall upon the floor. She shut it in the bread-bin whose lid she closed, then she wondered still if the bread-bin was well shut. She greatly feared mice, which are not large. She was afraid of cats, which are clever. A mere nothing would have sufficed for some creature to have got in beside the bread in her absence and, setting its teeth to it, devoured the best of it. She feared that a cockroach might eat a pound of it.

But the struggle was not to take place between the bread, the mice, the cats and the disorder that a child brings into households. There are other enemies for the bread of the poor, everything is an enemy for the bread of the poor. What they love is an enemy, what they hate is an enemy. Bread makes one think of their hearts, of those hearts of the sick that every emotion comes to strike. On days of good health, Solange Blanchard had a little more appetite and ate a little too much of the bread that she had had so much trouble earning. On days of illness she ate a little less than usual, but she feared that illness might come to prevent her from going to earn her bread. Joy as much as sorrow was to be feared. It seemed that bread held more place here than anywhere else, nothing passed without striking against it.

Among the days there were two each year that dealt it a famous blow. The first was the day of the eleventh of May, the second that of the eleventh of November. These were the days when the rent was due. They announced themselves from afar. The eleventh of May was already advancing on the evening of the eleventh of November. The eleventh of November cost Solange Blanchard twenty francs. She told herself then that the eleventh of May would come in six months, that is to say in one hundred and eighty days. The eleventh of May would cost her twenty francs again, it was as if each of the days that separated her from it were to cost her two sous. It is better not to say that there were two days each year that did harm to the bread. Each day had its importance, at the price flour was, each day took a pound from you. Time does not pass without asking you to pay it a toll. At night itself, when you sleep, each of the hours that strike steals from you a piece of bread. When they walked they did wrong to the bread, for they wore out their clogs. When they were seated, their clothes rubbed against the straw of their chair. When they were outside, the rain drowned the fabric of their garments, or else the sun dried it up, or else the mud ate it. And the linen that one soils! Once the child had lice, the lice of the poor are stubborn, one had to resign oneself to buying two sous' worth of grey ointment. We have been taught since 1849 that life is a constant struggle, that the spirit of death assails us, that in our very bodies war is declared, the bad cells devote their time to assailing the good ones, wanting to devour the life of the living. Solange Blanchard had a glimpse of the truth before the discoveries of the Pasteur Institute. Whatever she occupied herself with, whatever her attention, whichever way she turned to face the danger, she was assailed by a thousand enemies who attacked her bread. Events occurred such as this: the child was growing, his clogs hurt his feet, the sleeves of his coat reached only to his elbows, there was no longer room for his shoulders. He was going to need clothes. It was going to require, to buy clothes, a great deal of money with which one would not buy bread. The bread that he had eaten had made him grow. Bread itself made war on bread!

This was the law of God that the poor learn much more quickly than the rest of us to know, and without needing to look at evil under a microscope, for it surrounds them and falls under their senses. Solange Blanchard felt herself a very small thing beside a natural law, she felt herself very weak in the midst of the elements: was it not the will that governs the world that was attacking her bread!

For a long time the only resistance she opposed to it was to weep. She hoped by her tears to move she knew not whom in the universe. She did not wipe them away, she let them flow; a moment comes when your cheeks stream, when a warm water spreads everywhere over your face, when your very mouth is penetrated by it: it is your tears that you drink! She felt their taste: they are always more bitter than one had believed!

And this sediment they contain, when they have dried, leaves upon the skin a sort of mud that shows that you have wept. Sometimes, toward evening, when she looked at herself in the mirror, black patches and furrows around her cheekbones made her resemble those old women who no longer wash themselves because they are too near death to have to take care of their faces. She was quite red, she was quite dirty, she was quite ugly. She raised her face to heaven and said:

"Look, Lord, at what state you have put your servant in!"

She ended, moreover, by growing weary of tears. The day came when, displeased at having wept so long, sated with sorrows and not having been consoled, she bore a grudge against sorrow itself, a little as one bears a grudge against a friend from whom one expected a service. She made every effort to push it away. She reflected much and tried to find no matter what that might hold in her life the place that sorrow held there. She said to herself:

"There might perhaps be another way than shedding these tears which have hardly served me until now."

For a time she thought of looking for work. One imagines quickly where work leads. Work permits one to pay the rent, work permits one to have clothes, work permits one to have bread. Well-paid work would permit still more: you could have, to eat with your bread, many things the thought of which has not yet come to you: potatoes and cheese; you could make a vegetable soup. She did not want so much. She was like those invalids who dare not ask for the complete cure of their illness, but who would be so happy if they could suffer a little less! She bore a grudge against sorrow: now he who works has no more need to weep.

She repeated to herself many times:

"Ah! yes, I would need to find work!"

She did not know how to go about it. At the first attempt, she began to think that the rich have their servants who do all their work and that it is there where one might find a place that all the places are taken. There remained indeed some persons who employed a charwoman, but for two of these persons she was already working. She came even to tell herself that she had been very lucky.

An event occurred. She learned that one of her neighbours, whose husband was a mason and earned good wages, had found work sweeping the church on Saturday and earned that day twenty sous.

Another woman would have said to herself:

"Here is a thing I had not thought of. There must be others still."

Solange Blanchard did not act thus. She said to herself:

"There was still some work. It has just been taken. Now there is nothing left."

It was a fine hope that departed, it was a great event, that one. It was not simply a matter of work that consisted of sweeping the church and with which she had not been charged, it was a matter of the last thing that, upon the earth, was offered to whoever wished to seize it: it had just been snatched from her.

Time passed. It happened sometimes, when she set her bread upon the table, that she would plant herself there and begin to examine it. Although she gave it great value, she was nevertheless aware of its defects. She said:

"It is very black and very ugly."

She ate a piece of the crust: it had the taste of stones. She ate a handful of crumb: it had the taste of sand.

She said then:

"If only one had enough of it!"

She weighed the piece in her hand; she was hardly ever mistaken in her estimates: there remained so many pounds! Little mattered the quality, it would have been better had it been worse still and had more of it remained. To be bad would have been for bread the best of qualities. Perhaps, had the crust been harder and the crumb more crumbled, they would not have been able to make disappear those enormous slices that they managed to eat.

One day, however, Solange Blanchard emerged from these calculations. As they say in mathematics, she believed she had found the solution. One always ends by finding something, when one searches. She made a true invention. The principle of it was quite simple. One day she said to herself:

"If I could manage to eat less bread! In that way, what we have would last longer."

She imagined a singular combination. Everyone has been able to observe in life that one must not eat between meals on pain of no longer being hungry at the moment of sitting down to table. Thus persons who are not in the habit of having a snack at four o'clock are punished the day they allow themselves to be led into doing so. At the evening meal, they notice that the snack, as they say, has cut their appetite.

The invention of Solange Blanchard proceeded from this principle. She waited until it was four o'clock, and when four o'clock struck, she lifted the lid of the bread-bin. A little piece, she believed, adding itself to the bread she had eaten at noon, would, in a stomach still full, produce a swelling and prevent digestion from occurring with the rapidity it usually had. At seven o'clock, indeed, it seemed to her she was not hungry. She served the child and was able to say to him without lying:

"As for me, I have eaten, my little one."

She watched him eat. She was truly astonished not to have had this idea sooner. She ate a great deal, usually, and at the evening meal, had she not reasoned with herself, she could have eaten a pound of bread.

But there befell her what has befallen many inventors, whose imagination was lively and outran by some distance the truth which always takes its time. The first evening, she did not accept the results of the experiment and preferred to wait until the next day, believing by her obstinacy to force nature to follow her. What had happened was this: at seven o'clock, she was not hungry, but at eight o'clock, she had the very clear impression that her stomach had grown larger, that what she had given it at four o'clock more than usual had increased its volume, and that an enormous stomach, a giant's stomach, was imposing upon her a hunger against which she was too weak to struggle. She did not eat, however, by virtue of this reasoning:

"Well then, it is time to go to bed. I do not need to eat in order to sleep."

The next day, she was cruelly punished. At noon, cost what it might, she had to satisfy her hunger. And as in the evening she would not give in and repeated the four o'clock trick, she was obliged at eight o'clock, on pain of fainting, to take the bread from the bread-bin and eat four quarters of it, that is to say until she felt at ease. One might even say, comparing what she had cut from her meal of the day before to what she had just added to her meal of today, that the experiment had not turned to her advantage and that the bread came out of it diminished.

That was a sad day, that one. It is a sad day when one realizes there is nothing to do but wait for what is going to happen. She repeated to herself once more:

"My God, what is to become of me!"

She did not become much of anything.

It was a day in the month of August, the afternoon of the fourth of August 1849, at two o'clock, that she rose from her chair without anything having announced beforehand that she was deciding to take a resolution. She had no hesitation. She seized a large basket; she possessed two of them: all things considered, she took hold of the larger one. The child was beside her. She said to him:

"Come now, come with me, my Charles!"

She carefully closed the door, she was in the street. The child regarded her with surprise. Perhaps she feared he might question her; she said to him in a tone of command:

"Come along, come!"

Then she walked. Her life was beginning.

She took the main road; already she went with an even and somewhat slow step, like those who have long practised the main roads and know how one must behave with them. Her basket hung from her left arm; she leaned to the right to make a counterweight; she lowered her head and recalled those poor women who, knowing that all one can see along the roads does not belong to them, no longer wish to look at what is around them. The child was still very young. He walked like the little colt beside its mother, quickening his step, running, playing, stopping sometimes. He considered her from in front, from the side, from behind, made a circuit around her. He ended by tiring of the game, and said:

"Where are we going, Mama?"

She could not have been going there with pleasure, she answered rather curtly:

"You bother me, you will see."

A little further on, she turned left and entered a small country lane that seduced the child at once on account of its roughness, on account of the hedges, on account of some oaks that, planted at the edge of the fields, cast a shade so good that he ran to receive it. From oak to oak, he made the journey: the sky was pure, the sun was hot, from oak to oak he refreshed himself: the shade had the taste of a glass of water. The birds did as he did, and when they perched among the leaves, they celebrated in their language the victory they had just won over a greedy sun. He saw one that, its head raised, was swaying its tail, and seemed to be shaking a joy so lively that one would have wished, like it, to be a little bird.

He spoke of it to his mother, he wanted to show it to her, he asked:

"Is that the one they call the nightingale?"

She did not even look and answered:

"I do not know."

It was not until a little further on that she emerged from her thoughts. By dint of having walked along the roads, they arrived near a farmhouse. She felt at once the need to have courage, and, to see if she was capable of it, as the child said nothing, she began to speak:

"You see, it is the farm of La Garenne. We are going to see old mother Renon."

Old mother Renon, who was in the yard feeding the poultry, saw them arrive with surprise. She did not yet know. She cried out:

"So it is you, my Solange? And you have brought this big boy?"

Solange began without preamble:

"My poor mother Renon, there is no other way. I must bring myself to come to you."

Old mother Renon was a country woman with a big belly, large breasts, her shoulders were broad. She had given birth, she had nursed, she had taken her share of all the labours. Now she was old, her role had changed; she no longer went into the fields, she stayed at the house. She was called the Mother. She fed the cows, she fed the pigs, she fed the hens. She drew the milk, she prepared the meal for the men. All day long, at the byre, at the stable, at the kitchen, she busied herself with hay, she busied herself with bran, she busied herself with potatoes, with bread, with soup, with dairy. She never sat at table, but as she fed the others, she knew what it was to be hungry. She had for the poor the very gesture she had for all that was around her.

"You need this much bread, my Solange... If you had come a little later, we would have had pears. Do take a cheese at least! Here are some eggs, but you will not speak of them to my sons... You must come back at chestnut time, I shall have apples and walnuts too... Ah! if you would wait until half past four, I would go and milk my cows. You would drink a little milk, wouldn't you, my little one?"

Solange answered:

"No, mother Renon, now that you have given us all we need, there is nothing left for us but to leave."

And on the threshold of the door, she recapitulated all the reasons she had had for coming:

"You see, I have tried everything. I have tried to look for work. How do you expect me to find any: I already have some! Then I tried to eat a little less, but I was falling into faintness. And then when one has wept all day, I assure you one is hungry in the evening! Well then, God's will be done! Now, you see, I am searching for my bread."

She searched for her bread. It is a hard trade. When she had bread, she noticed that there are things in life that count as much as bread.

Certainly, she was well received at the farms. The dogs barked but did not rush at her. The women saw her coming, opened the door and shouted at the dog:

"Be quiet, you nasty beast!"

They said to her:

"And me, my poor Solange, if I came to lose my man, what would I have to do? I have two children. I would have to search for my bread too."

These words did not console Solange, but on the contrary showed her that it would have taken a great misfortune for the other women to reach the point where she was.

And besides, however well they received her, she was not sure of herself. A caprice would have sufficed, a whim; it would have sufficed that once, not having thanked the people warmly enough, she had offended them, for those who do good like it to be noticed. They would not have hesitated to say to her:

"I cannot give you anything. I need my bread for myself."

The bread that was given to her, moreover, caused her no pleasure. She set it on the table, she left it there for a time, she was a little sad, she was a little ashamed. She said:

"Certainly, it is good bread, but I have not the heart to eat it."

They gave her big pieces. It was sometimes a golden loaf, without rye or bran, in which nothing entered but flour. One had only to have the saliva, the bread melted in the mouth, the bread ate itself.

The child was happy. He did not yet realize, he had just discovered that one could eat something good. Sometimes, for no reason, for the pleasure of it, he said:

"Mama, I am hungry."

She cut him good slices. He walked about the house to take a stroll while eating them. Then he began to sing. She did not much like that. She said:

"One must not be gay, my little one, it is bread that we have begged."
