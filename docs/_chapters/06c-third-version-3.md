III / THE MARKET

Here is why it is fitting to speak first of certain encounters that Charles Blanchard made at the Market square, which was, naturally, the first place where he stopped in the course of his outings.

The Market was held on Thursdays. The stalls were arranged in three rows. On the right, going down, one saw the vegetables and the fruits, in the middle the eggs, the cheeses and the butter, and on the left were displayed the chickens, the ducks and the geese. It was the gathering of all the provisions that are necessary to man, and one even encountered some, such as partridges or quails, that tempted no one, but that were there in case some passer-by full of extravagance had decided to commit a folly.

The child, for reasons that were rather easy to foresee, first made the acquaintance of all the fruits, and he formed, on the same occasion, relations with the vegetables their neighbours. It was at this time that Charles Blanchard experienced great surprises. He saw pell-mell, in the course of that year, in a great disorder where the seasons were confused: cabbages, turnips, carrots, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, cauliflowers, spinach, pears, apples, cherries, strawberries, grapes, and those peaches that seem alive, that have flesh, skin, such a fine complexion that a feeling of a higher order adds itself to the pleasure one feels in eating them. He did not ignore, assuredly, that all this existed beforehand upon the earth; he had seen pears on the pear trees, cabbages in the gardens, but the question did not pose itself then in the same way. He found that the pear trees looked well in the fields, the pears well on the pear trees, and that it was in good taste to grow cabbages in the kitchen gardens. When one walked through the world with a little attention, one encountered things that seemed placed here and there for the pleasure of the eyes.

Charles Blanchard had the revelation of an entire unsuspected world; what did he not learn on that day! Certainly, he used his two eyes to look well, but his two eyes did not put him in sufficient relations with all that he had to see. It was as if a new sense made room for itself among those he already used to learn to know the Universe. There occurred a phenomenon comparable to a landslide, a part of himself collapsed and left in the very middle of his body an enormous void that all he saw could scarcely have filled. It seemed to him very quickly that he appreciated and judged things with an organ more powerful still than his eyes: with his stomach!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A new life began. It is not with impunity that one has felt great feelings. During the days that followed market day, it seemed to Charles Blanchard that he had lost something. He went through one by one the streets of the small town where he lived, he looked around him with great care, he could not bring himself to return to his house. He was seen passing here and there. He walked with small steps, he rubbed against the walls, he stopped before the shops, he planted himself near a dog, near a cat, near a passer-by, near a cart, near an open window. One does not know what was the object of his searches, but he pursued them with avidity. All that he perceived was submitted to a long examination: he asked himself if this was it!

Many times he was ready to seize strange things. What would he not have picked up! What would he not have carried between his arms and pushed to the depths of himself to fill a bizarre void that he felt in his soul and in his body! It seemed to him that, from head to heel, he was hollow like a hole. He had learned, on market day, that he was hungry. He no longer knew, now, for what he was hungry. He walked through the world after a whole life of fasting, each of his steps was destined to make him find a little nourishment, he picked up everything that a small town can leave lying about.

They were numerous days, they were all the days of those summers that we lived when we were ten years old. Each morning at seven o'clock, as soon as his mother had left, Charles Blanchard in his house did not feel in his place. A voice in the street, a voice through the town, a voice under the heavens made itself at first very soft and went to his heart, then, if he delayed a few...
