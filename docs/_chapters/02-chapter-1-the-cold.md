One cannot even say that the house of Charles Blanchard was the last house in the town. She occupied a place apart. The other houses seemed to maintain among themselves relations of friendship; they were one beside the other; as they resembled one another, they had gathered together and gave reason to believe they were family. They looked upon the houses across the way which had ranged themselves on the other side of the street, as when one faces one's partner in a pleasure party. There had to be a first, there had to be a last. The last like the first belonged to the group and received in the manner of the other houses that joy which small towns have come seeking in the countryside.

The house of Charles Blanchard had not mingled with those others. To the right, going up, in a little street, quite set apart, one saw her; she was capped with a very low thatched roof, she made one think of an old woman who had sat down at a certain distance from the road and who, over her eyes, had drawn down her hood because she no longer took interest in what might pass.

By dint of bowing her head, she had bent at the shoulder; her walls leaned, she was misshapen, she was a little broken.

Houses resemble us. One might have believed that a great sorrow she had conceived because she was thus made had led her to withdraw from men and to seek a corner where nothing could tear her from her destiny.

When one opened the door and entered the single room, one perceived first of all everything she did not contain. There was not that peace which makes it so that after work, one comes home, one sits down, and one feels removed from cares. There were not those souvenirs of victory that furniture is, that everyday objects ranged in good order are, beside which one rests with pride thinking: I have had much trouble, but all that surrounds me, I have conquered it. There was not that light which seems to belong to you, which is that of your house and resembles not the light of neighbouring houses. It illuminates, it embraces things in the manner in which your soul illuminates them, embraces them, understands them. One thought quite quickly: Here is a house I could not inhabit!

Four walls watched over the room, full of rough stones, with nothing to soften their hardness, in a terrible vis-a-vis, in an implacable severity, four walls between which the black floor was bare. The shadow they poured forth, troubled by the greenish daylight of a low window, had withdrawn into the corners awaiting its hour. When evening comes here, one will be quite alone, in a world quite hard.

Those companions of our life that furniture is: a clock, an armoire, a sideboard, one after another had fled, and if there still remained a table, three chairs, the bed and the bread-bin, they scarcely consoled you, for they reminded you ceaselessly that only they remained. One of the chairs was even beginning to depart. She had collapsed, her rungs had been gathered together so that she might still make a figure, but the legs and the back leaned and showed plainly that one must not count upon their support.

Such was the house of Charles Blanchard. It was here, at the age of seven, when it seems that in the soul of a child a hundred souls of children stir and wish to escape, it was here that Charles Blanchard came to take his place. Certainly, he wished to go elsewhere. More than one thing in this world called to him with great insistence. When Galand the blacksmith, in company with his workman, beat the red iron, a rain of sparks leapt forth and radiated, so beautiful that one rejoiced to have lived long enough to be able to contemplate it. The Chinese kiosk in the garden of Monsieur Tardy was capped with a roof of six angles, from each of which was suspended a little bell, and when the wind blew, six little bells tinkled. The sun, the azure of the sky, the trees, the meadows, the birds, the dogs, the cats, the horses, all things, all creatures upon the Earth existed with a joy, with a force that he admired in his heart. He would have departed as children depart: their eyes shine, it seems their eyes precede them upon the road.

Charles Blanchard rose each day a little before seven in the morning. His mother woke him:

"Get up quickly, my little boy. I must go to do my housework."

He did not make her wait. When she had made the bed, she left. She never forgot to say:

"Sit on your chair, stay there quietly. You will rest until I return."

When she had said that, she was still a little afraid, and she developed her thoughts in a sort of little speech:

"Above all, do not go into the street, my Charles. You would run, you would catch a heat. Remember always what I told you of your poor father. He had gone into the countryside and he came home all in a sweat. When he wished to rest, he caught cold and he died of pneumonia in six days."

From seven o'clock to nine o'clock, it did not seem to the child that he was alone, because his mother's words lived in his head and drew his ideas into their movement. He followed them and was not bored. He sat down; a little later they subsided a little, but he gathered them up, he kept them, he pressed them to his heart, they did him good. He understood them. He thought:

"I must not go out because I would catch pneumonia and I would die in six days."

At nine o'clock, the mother, having finished her first housework, returned to the house to eat her piece of bread. She ate it very quickly, then she left to go do the housework of Monsieur Lhotte, the clerk of the justice of the peace. She had just time enough to say:

"Have you been good, my little one? Eat your piece of bread slowly, it will occupy you."

He ate his piece of bread slowly. He thought while eating each of his mouthfuls to make them last longer. His mother had left to go to the clerk's. He knew that it is cats one calls clerks. He believed his mother had gone to do the housework for a big cat. That lasted well until half past nine; sometimes, on his good days, he had a little longer, but at ten o'clock at the latest all was used up of what his mother had left him that morning. He had upon all things singular conceptions. He knew there existed in the world a woman who loved him, he believed there existed others, that other mothers would come open the door and say to him: My little boy, I have come to keep you company. He awaited them with patience and since he was all alone, he made use of the time to prepare to receive them.

At five past ten, they were not there, at ten past ten, he was surprised, at quarter past ten, life was no doubt not made as he had believed. He was not astonished by this, for he was very small. He held himself on his chair and, not without curiosity, watched how life could possibly be made.

How was life made? He did not miss a glance. He looked in the four corners, but they were too dark for him to discover it if it had been there. He raised his head afterwards to see well the beams of the ceiling, but they were too low and must prevent it from being able to fit in the room. He looked at the floor at his feet; he scratched it a little with the tip of his clog to see if it might not appear. He knew well it was not outside, there where his father had caught a malady whose name he had forgotten and which he did not remember very well whether it was held in the chest or in the stomach. Life was nowhere, it had no doubt not arrived. He awaited it, he stayed on his chair, he made not a gesture for he might have frightened it, he opened his eyes wide so that it might not come without his seeing it, he gathered all his limbs together to be ready to accompany it when it came. Each day it was long in coming, it was long in coming until noon. How was it made? As soon as it brushed the door he rose from his chair, he ran to be at once beside her. His mother entered. He understood then that life was made like his mother.

On arriving she said:

"My little one, we shall have to eat."

He obeyed her, setting himself at the table.

Eating was not for them one of those complicated operations which take certain persons an hour and a half. Their meal was composed of a piece of bread and a piece of cheese. It offered nonetheless certain difficulties. Each day the mother said to the child:

"Come, try to eat some cheese. It will do you no harm: I eat it well enough!"

Never was he able to eat cheese. Sometimes he made an act of good will: he cut a piece. But as soon as he had it in his mouth, a feeling of horror took hold of him entirely, he was afraid. He closed his eyes so as to see nothing, then suddenly, while there was still time, he spat out his mouthful of cheese. He spat again several times all the saliva he could gather to wash well from an infamous contact his tongue and his palate. His mother had nothing left but to resign herself and say:

"It is a great misfortune, my little one, not to like cheese."

One cannot absolutely say he ate his bread dry. He had realised a sort of invention. He set apart from his slice of bread a very small piece. He said to himself: There, that will be my fare, that will be what I eat with my bread. He bit with full teeth into the slice and took from his fare a crumb which he added to his mouthful of bread. Sometimes he imagined it was sausage, sometimes half a pear, sometimes jam. Certain days even he said to himself:

"Today it is butter. It is quite fresh."

Charles Blanchard always felt a great relief when he had finished his meal. He said:

"There it is, mama, I am no longer hungry."

He did not know very well what was going to happen next. He rose, to be ready to leave. He understood now why no one had come in the morning: they had waited until he had eaten, so he remained standing. His mother ended by remarking upon it:

"Will you not sit down, my Charles. You stand there all upright."

He could sit down indeed. For a long time he consoled himself with the thought that he sat only for an instant.

Charles Blanchard became accustomed early to the idea that each day, when one o'clock strikes, all the women of France have a duty to mend their skirts.

It happens sometimes that it is at the knee; other times at the hip, or in the hem: in the hem in front, in the hem behind, or in the hem at the sides. But it always happens that at the last moment they say:

"Well, I give up. I do not know why I try. It is better to give it up."

They have besides troubles with the colour of the wool.

It had happened once to the mother of Charles Blanchard, at Rondreux the grocer's, to discover a ball of wool that had done nicely for her: it was a ball that had remained in the window in the sun during a whole summer.

Charles Blanchard came to know that little children should come right after their mother's skirt and that they would need like her to be followed, to be seen closely, to be repaired a little, because something is no longer in its place in their heads. As for him, he waited until the skirt hour was entirely passed, but he said then:

"Mama, I am bored."

His mother was a good mother. She gave him counsel:

"You must not be bored, my little one. See then, stay on your chair, watch me, it will distract you."

He did all he could not to be bored. He watched her. She was called Solange, Solange Blanchard. When she had done with her skirt, she had not done with all her occupations.

She looked around her first of all to see what she had to do. She looked everywhere for fear of forgetting something. She looked straight ahead to begin. She saw the wall opposite. Charles Blanchard did not know well what it is to read: he had once seen people who were reading a poster placed beside the door of the town hall: they had planted themselves, they had looked at the wall for a long time, he believed his mother too was reading a poster he could not see, but which was placed on the wall of her house. She looked afterwards into the corners and it was no doubt to know more. She did not stop there, for the ceiling would then have escaped her attention.

When she had looked at it for a moment, it seemed the ceiling lowered a little, put itself within her reach to make itself better known. After that she was ignorant of only one thing and she passed it in her study. She had to learn what the floor of a house teaches you when you have long scratched it with the corner of your clog.

There arrived a moment when Solange Blanchard had finished this first part of her task. First of all she remained absolutely still. There is reason to believe she did not wish to hasten and that before drawing profit from them she was gathering, grouping the observations she had made. Her face expressed calm, reflection, wisdom; each of her features was well in its place; her eyes did not shine like the eyes of enthusiastic children, but a measured flame testified to the good order that reigned in her mind. When later, a man studies the life of his own and seeks there the essential traits, when later Charles Blanchard remembered his mother, and wished to represent her to himself, he chose the expression of face she had in those moments. It seemed then she bore her whole soul, one saw it.

It was with certainty that she acted afterwards. She arrived at such a result because it was at such a result one must arrive. She did such a thing because it was such a thing one must do, and he who had been at her side would have watched her with great attention so that she might teach him a truth he had no doubt not fathomed as she had.

Her eyes widened first of all, she possessed what she had sought, her eyes were bathed in it, her gaze itself was caught, and upon her pupil something had settled which seemed to have a certain weight. It grew larger, then at a given moment, no effort could have retained it, it detached itself. One perceived then upon the cheek of Solange a heavy tear, round, which rolled and came to flatten itself upon the cloth of her dress. It was the first, but the others came after it. Soon one had to give up seeing them one by one. The poor woman recalled those orators who are full of their subject, and as they speak, she wept in abundance.

Charles Blanchard wept first because he saw his mother weep. His first tear too was heavy, was round, his first tear was followed by all the others, he had no wrinkle that could impose upon them a direction, they flowed a little at random, but for those which made their way to the corner of his lips, he did not cheat with them, he received them in his mouth and used all his conscience to appreciate well the taste. He did not fall behind, he did not take out his handkerchief to wipe them, those that wished to go into his neck went into his neck; they went further still, upon his little chest of a thin child. Some fell upon his smock, some fell upon his trousers. He would have been quite unhappy if they had failed him. He feared not having enough of them. He looked at his mother once more to imitate her still better. He would have been sad if she had stopped, for he still had the strength to weep.

Charles Blanchard ate at seven o'clock, each day, a bowl of onion soup. He was in bed, occupying the place at the back, by quarter past seven and fell asleep quite quickly, being very tired.

When he was eight years old, it happened to him several times to leave the house. This took place ordinarily toward two o'clock in the afternoon, that is to say at the moment when, in company with his mother, he was about to begin weeping. Solange had even already begun the preparatory work which consisted of looking around her and thinking about what she had seen. She rose suddenly, she gave a brusque movement, it seemed she detached herself violently from her chair and that following a quarrel she had decided to quit her surroundings. She said then:

"My little one, you must come."

He rose, he did not yet know where he was, when he found himself already outside. Solange barely took time to lock her door with a double turn. She set off and took the road that leads into open country.

The first impression that, upon this road, Charles Blanchard felt was that of a world to which he was not accustomed. Space was so vast, the sky was so high, the light was so pure that he could not believe such a thing existed. He was intimidated, he would not have dared advance toward what he saw. He waited for his mother to invite him to follow.

The trees were green, the earth was white, birds alighted among the leaves, and as they sang, he did not doubt they were those one calls nightingales. What would he not have wished! He would have wished to be the nightingale. But the entire Universe was too beautiful for one to accept it at first stroke. He did not know it well enough; the world could mock men, Charles Blanchard mistrusted it, and feared it might conceal some trap.

He did not take long to perceive he was right to think thus. The four steps barely taken which brought him to the main road, one had to begin walking. His mother carried a basket on her left arm, he took the right. She held herself a little bent when she climbed the hills, he understood one must hold oneself a little bent when one climbs a hill. They were roads without end, after the climbs there were the descents, in nature only the roads counted. His mother lowered her head, they were two to lower their heads. After a little while they were two to know that what is on each side of the road was not made for them. They looked at nothing for fear of losing their time seeing useless things. The child did not know where the roads lead; he had seen how vast space is, the roads are meant to traverse it; at each step he believed one would have to walk forever. He could not help complaining. Sometimes he said:

"Mama, I am weary."

A summer sun, that which lights the fine days and which makes it that at their last hour even the men who, beyond death, believe they will find Heaven leave the earth only weeping, a beautiful sun embraced the entire countryside and loved it as a father loves the best of his children. Beautiful vapours of a blue colour rose toward it, the countryside seemed to answer it with a gentle feeling, the child of the sun repaid it in return. Of all this Charles Blanchard knew but one thing. He said:

"Mama, I am hot."

By dint of being hot, by dint of being weary and having left the main road for those country paths where the rocks, the stones, the earth hollowed by the wide wheels of ox-carts are personal enemies for those who travel them, they perceived at last some farm whose courtyard was immense and at the entrance of which watched two jealous dogs who did not wait until they had entered to declare war upon them. There was one for the mother and one for the child. The dogs seemed rather to push them than to follow them. They obeyed them, they traversed the whole extent of the courtyard, they were led to the master who, on the threshold of the house, squinted his eyes to see them better and who, when they arrived at his height, went away, perhaps for fear of having to pardon them the audacity they had shown in entering his domain.

It was before the women that Solange explained herself. She was capped with a capeline, she drew it down over her face while climbing the steps that led to the kitchen, then, as she entered, she inclined her head to the right and began to weep. She could say nothing. The women were not cruel. They addressed no reproach to her. They took possession of her basket, passed into the room beside, left them alone a moment, then brought back the basket saying:

"Will that not be too heavy for you, my Solange?"

They returned during the rest of the afternoon carrying their basket. It was four o'clock: the world and life were what they had been all day, walking was that attentive movement which takes you entirely, quite small, upon roads without limit, Nature was that great expanse in which one walks carrying a basket. They ended by yielding to it, they felt a sort of discouragement before the distance that separated them from their house, and cost what it may, the mother, the basket, the child, on the edge of a ditch... but they scarcely dared rest because they were not at home. One does not know what they feared. They held themselves very straight so the master of the countryside might find nothing to reproach in their bearing. After a moment, Solange took a little assurance and cast a glance about to see if anyone was coming, then, hastily, furtively, afraid of being seen, she looked at what her basket contained. It contained bread, a cheese, some pears.

They set off at once, one would have said they were fleeing.

Spending great courage, they ended by arriving home. By good fortune, the house had not changed during their absence. They entered as one enters, they sat down, their chair was their friend, they rested. Solange was first to emerge from the torpor in which they were plunged. She rose, she suddenly remembered that on the table she had placed a basket, she suddenly remembered that during the afternoon of the day that had passed, she had made a strange voyage; she rose to find the sad souvenir of it. Everything was there, it was not a dream. She placed upon the table the cheese and the pears, she took hold of the bread. It was seven o'clock, the hour at which they usually ate. She could not bring herself to place the bread simply, among the pears, beside the cheese. She went to the window, she looked at it, she brought it close to her eyes, she felt it, she touched it successively with each of the five fingers of her right hand, then she smelled it. She smelled the crumb, she smelled the crust, she returned upon her first impression to smell it again; when she had smelled it well, she reflected for a time to be quite sure she had not been mistaken.

She said afterwards:

"It is good bread, but I have not the heart to eat it."

The child might perhaps have let himself go to joy, because of the pears, but he dared not have other feelings than those his mother showed him. Certainly he ate since he was hungry, but he was a little ashamed to be hungry, he tried not to make noise swallowing the mouthfuls which, timidly, he brought to his mouth. When he had finished his first piece of bread, for all the world he would not have accepted a second. There came to him upon life extraordinary ideas, perhaps they came from having walked all day and from having seen more things than a child should see. He who never spoke, it seemed delirium was about to take him, he spoke:

"Is what we did today called seeking one's bread, mama?"

One did not know where he could have taken those words. She answered him while putting him to bed. He was quite happy to fall asleep, it seemed to him he had something to forget.

Such was the life which, all around Charles Blanchard, reigned in the world when he was seven, when he was eight and when he turned nine. Perhaps, against it, there is much to say, but for many days the child did not open his mouth. If it was thus made, it was because it had the right to be so. He received it with submission, he sat because one must not be absent at its coming. He made not a single gesture afterwards, for it had not commanded him to; he took not a step, for fear that in its thought it had decided he must remain seated.

He received it. Ceaselessly there detached themselves from it those minutes which fall with a light sound, which slowly cover your head, your shoulders, your limbs and which, when evening comes, make you feel you carry a burden.

From eight to nine years old, he made several voyages into the countryside and they were like his first voyage. He had not reached the point where one perceives that others are not ourselves and that their life is not like ours; it was much later he reached the age of reason, that he could make comparisons, know the place he occupied in this world and say to himself seeing certain persons: I do things they do not do, I perform functions foreign to them, I belong to a class that is not theirs. At eight years old he did not even make the difference between those who give bread and those who receive it, he judged human activity by his own actions alone and believed all men, like his mother and him, traversed the roads, head bowed, with this fatigue, to go seek in certain depots bread, cheese and pears.

He believed still and above all that fathers are dead, that mothers each morning do housework, that children await them and that the afternoon and the evening pass in dark houses where time watches you and does not leave until the hour you go to bed. His life was life, he was bored because one must be bored; when he ate dry bread, it was because the Earth produced only dry bread. He did not imagine there existed other things that could be eaten, and unless one lived on the Moon where, within reach of the hand, one has the blue of the sky and the clouds that cover it and where there are perhaps pears every day in every house, Charles Blanchard reckoned his lot was the common lot and that he could not desire more.

Each second in falling drove him further into these feelings, it seemed each hour gave the order to the hour that followed it and that the days pursued a goal which was to smother him beneath that sediment each of them deposited upon his head before withdrawing. There came even heavier ones, thicker ones than those he had received at the age of seven, there came ones which, by their weight, bent him like an old man and drove him to believe he could not carry them long.

There came winter days. When Charles Blanchard was seven, it did not seem to him he had crossed a single winter, at the end of each year he had noticed but one thing: that a very long year had just departed. At the age of nine, perhaps he was weary of having carried so many days, it seemed to him his burden grew heavier and that upon his shoulders there settled still a thing called winter.

Winter was first and foremost a season during which it is cold. Winter was so cold it was necessary to light a fire. Solange Blanchard waited until the last moment, she resisted for a week, for one day more, she did not wish to believe in the bad season, she said:

"We are only at the beginning of November. It is not possible the good season is finished."

A morning arrived at last when, after a quarter hour of waiting, she had to admit it: the fine weather was not returning! She assembled in the hearth two or three little pieces of wood, she had still to spend an entire match.

On leaving, she arranged beside the hearth a provision of wood for the child. She said:

"Do not make bad use of it. If you are cold, instead of putting on a piece, come closer to the fire."

She was not an imprudent mother when she said these words. There was no fear indeed that the child might fall into the fire, first because he was very calm and measured his movements, and then if he had fallen into the fire, it is not the fire that would have destroyed Charles Blanchard, but Charles Blanchard who would have destroyed the fire.

He broke each piece of wood in two to have twice as much. They were little pieces of dry wood, little pieces of faggot, they burned quite quickly. He placed himself full in the hearth, a foot on each side of the fire and did not need for this, moreover, to spread his legs very far, he leaned a little, he put his head just above the flame, and although he was not very tall, never did it succeed in reaching him. In the early times, when the wood burned well, when for example there were three pieces, it was so good he had a headache from it. But soon winter became so cold, he never again had the headache and it would have been necessary even that he be small as an ember and crouched in the middle of the flames to be able to feel the warmth.

Charles Blanchard had many occupations during winter. His whole morning was taken. His back occupied him, his hips occupied him, his hands occupied him, and as for his feet, he had once heard his mother say: I can no longer feel my feet; he did not succeed in gathering the exact terms she had used but he reconstituted the same thought in these terms:

"I have lost my feet."

All morning he strove to find what he had lost. When he found his feet again, he was missing something in the shoulders, a little later he was at his hands, then he felt at the tip of his nose the ridiculous sensation of a great void. Never did he succeed in gathering himself entirely. He imagined singular poses: in a half-circle, with the fire in the middle, but he arrived at no decisive result, for if his chest was presented to the warmth, to the cold his back was offered. Other times he crouched, he made himself as small as one can be: head between legs, knees at ears, hands at feet, but he tired quite quickly, and then he was not the personage he should have been. He should have been Charles Blanchard standing, head high, limbs free, heart beating, Charles Blanchard upright and living at his ease.

It was during the afternoons he learned things more grave still. On arriving, Solange said:

"What am I to do? Here we are going to burn wood until seven or eight o'clock. At the tax collector's I have four francs, at Monsieur Lhotte's I have six. Ten francs a month, that makes us six sous a day, my little one, and I have thirty francs of rent, which is to say that each morning when I rise I have already spent two sous. I assure you with the four sous we have left we cannot go very far. So, do your best not to be cold, you see how I must calculate when I put a piece of wood on the fire."

For a long time, Charles Blanchard did his best not to be cold. For a long time he warmed himself, as they say, with the warmth of his thoughts. He had no notion of the length of winter, so each evening on going to bed, he oriented his thoughts in the best direction so they might give him pleasure at their ease. He set himself to believe that the next day, on waking, the good season would have come while he slept. He said:

"It will be warm tomorrow, will it not, mama?"

It was never warm the next day. There were days of snow which were not the hardest, even with their dampness, for there were days of frost when the cold entered under the door like a torrent and would have swept away a warmth much stronger than that of the hearth of Solange Blanchard. Winter swept all before its passage, and gathering up the feelings with which each one strove to surround his heart, winter carried them off like down and left you a soul quite naked upon which it reigned with fury. One thing alone existed: it was called suffering. It was indisputable that it was there, the child shivered, and in the position he had adopted, astride the fire, as his mother said, he felt it pass through him like a current of cold water and freeze that confidence he had until then placed in living.

He did not know how long winter lasted. Winter was a season from which one did not succeed in escaping. Each day, toward four o'clock in the afternoon, a powerful shadow, through the window, entered the room, and slowly, sure of victory, with a force, with a weight, advanced toward the woman and the child and imposed upon them its presence.

That was all that was missing! They did not know if it was black or if it was yellow. They fixed their eyes upon it, they felt it; they made with their arms the gesture of pushing it back, it was thick and resistant.

And at the moment they feared it most, it seemed it knew no halt in its march, that it crossed the doors of their senses and entered into them to make them know that odour of damp earth, that odour of cemetery that winter nights carry with them. It was too powerful for day ever to vanquish it. It seemed a new season began, more terrible still than winter. A thing existed, beside which the cold scarcely counted. The child did not think to approach that fire which, in the darkness, pierced a poor hole the width of an ember, he thought to guard against the shadow he felt invading him a little heart of nine years which was dying in his breast.

A new season began, which one might have called the season of the end of life. How slow the hours were, how long the hours were, how heavy the hours were! And then, sometimes, it seemed to the child he was quite weary. He had seen so many pass! He had seen pass the file of the morning hours, he had seen pass the afternoon hours which go one by one and which give you the ridiculous sensation that one must yawn, that one must open one's mouth, one's throat and one's chest so they may enter and make their way through your body. The hours of night were so numerous one did not confront them, there was but one course of conduct toward them: to lie down, to sleep, to leave them the time, the life and the space. How long had this lasted? If Charles Blanchard had known how to count, he would have reckoned it had lasted a hundred years. He would have lacked the strength already to continue living as he had lived. But before the new hours, he had nothing left but to let himself be done with. It seemed to him, in the midst of a yawn, he could never open his mouth wide enough for them to enter. Old age was producing its first effects: the hinges of his jaws were no longer supple enough, the movement of his blood no longer quick enough, a great cold he felt was not the cold of winter, the shadow that surrounded him was not that of night. Yes, that was it: he was very old, the time had come when he must abandon himself to death.
