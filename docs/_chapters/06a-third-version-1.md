THIRD VERSION

Charles Blanchard, whose story I undertake today to tell you, showed at first no virtue, no particular genius that might have distinguished him among other children. I shall begin the account of his life as you would have begun the account of your own.

One day, a woman gave birth to a boy to whom she gave the Christian name that pleased her. One day, to the number of inhabitants of France, the mayor of a small town added one.

The child knew first how to cry, then he learned to laugh, he got teeth, he made gestures, he pronounced his first words, and as he had received life, he wanted to live it whole and was already trying at times to escape from his mother's hands to go mingle with all that he saw in the world.

At the age of fifteen months, when he could walk alone, he rushed toward the objects that surrounded him, he went from one to another and seized them in his arms.

He was happy to be two years old, then to be three years old, because he could go further and embrace still other objects.

At four years old, although he had touched all the things he had been able to reach, he had not exhausted a great curiosity that was at the bottom of himself and that soon pushed him to try to reach all the things he had not yet touched. This is why, when he was in his house, he set off for the street. When he was in the street, he did not stop there either and set off for the square; he would then have gone into the fields, into the woods, onto the roads and would not have been long in becoming, no one has the right to doubt it, the youngest of our explorers.

It was in the course of his travels that Charles Blanchard encountered all that he did not know. One cannot say that the world hides its face from us, each of our steps leads us on the contrary to a place where so many objects surround us that it seems the world wished to show us all that it contained.

Charles Blanchard learned of the existence of the sun, of the blue of the sky, of trees, of meadows, he learned that there were birds, dogs, cats, horses.

When he was small, he did not yet quite grasp all this. Life was comparable to those clearance shops which one knows contain everything one needs, but in the midst of which, the first time one visits them, one has great difficulty finding what one came to look for.

It was by frequenting assiduously the town and the countryside that Charles Blanchard came at last to notice, to classify their riches. He saw the sun which is so beautiful one cannot look upon it directly, the sky which one cannot reach and which is above all the objects of the earth, the trees in whose shade one hastens to go and sit, the meadows whose grass is so soft that if they were not closed by fences one would roll about in them all day long. He saw the birds that run and fly even further than children, the dogs that follow you without doing you harm, the cats that climb onto the roofs, the horses that gallop with such swiftness that one harnesses them to carriages to go faster.

He was happy to be part of a world that possessed such wonders. He lived in their midst, his feet carried him from one to another, his heart beat with each of his movements, and two large, two beautiful blue eyes in his face had such a flame that they seemed to possess a life particular and distinct from that which one saw him lead. They made you think of two friends who are drawing a third along to pleasure.

The air was soft then as it is when one is four years old. The air was so pure and penetrated so deeply into the chest of the child that it is not enough to say he breathed with his lungs. He breathed also with his soul. Sometimes, without cause, or perhaps simply because he felt the air of the sky swelling his throat, he could not contain himself, and with all his strength, like a bird, he answered the goodness of the world and let out at the top of his voice great, long cries of joy.

He was happy as children are happy. The morning made him happy, the afternoon made him happy, the evening made him happy. Each day had its manner of being, the days had different ways of making him happy. The whole universe answered to his happiness. Did he set foot in the street? He found there occasions for happiness that he did not yet know. One would think the world was created so that children might rejoice in it.

Everything was an adventure for him, chance sometimes came to meet him and presented him with happinesses such as he could not have foreseen. One day, he was passing before the house of Madame Emile Giron which was not made like the others. A courtyard preceded it with a gate. The gate was open that morning. He entered, he climbed the eight steps of the front stoop. Never had he climbed the steps of a front stoop. It was a fine adventure. Another time, as he was passing before the garden of Monsieur Tardy, the doctor, workmen were in the midst of installing a Chinese kiosk. He saw it set in place, there were little bells at each corner, and when the work was finished, a little wind blew and the little bells began to chime. He saw, one morning, Galand the blacksmith, in the company of his workman, beating the red iron, and a rain of sparks around the anvil burst forth and radiated so beautifully that he rejoiced at having lived until this day to have been able to contemplate it.
