That year, on the second Sunday of June, an event occurred which happy days, long in advance, ought to have foretold. When morning descended from the heavens, it was as if a new season were beginning. It was as if the heavens themselves were descending upon the Earth with the morning. The air one breathed had an unknown fragrance, a marvellous fragrance, and more than one person thought: It is a mystery, never has the small town where I live possessed such a perfume. The light was white and blue; if sometimes, at the end of a street, through a gap, one glimpsed the countryside, it was difficult to tell the difference between the colour of the sky and the colour of the fields. The houses that stood in the sun shone by natural law, and those that stood in shadow, an interior joy made them shine as well. Each person possessed in the very centre of his chest a pure heart, ready to receive great feelings. A new season was beginning, winter and sorrow had fled forever, one did not even think that morning would be followed by evening, then by night; it seemed that a whole century had just opened and that a Sunday without end, which would last until the consummation of time, had descended upon the Earth to dwell there.

One could scarcely recognise the Grande Place. Dark stalls, surrounded by canvas, which the day before had seemed rather to encumber it, had just undergone a marvellous transformation: at the first ray of sunlight, each of them had opened like a flower.

Charles Blanchard was greatly astonished. Yet he knew them. He had seen them the year before. There was the Aunt Sally where one could notice in passing the bride whose nose, as Villepreux the clockmaker had once said, was a turned-up nose. There was the shooting gallery. These were made for men, one had to have enough strength to throw the balls, one had to know how to handle a rifle. The lottery stalls were made for women. The women spun the wheel. When the wheel stopped, if they had not lost, they won a large vase of their choosing which one could afterwards see at their homes upon the mantelpiece.

The stalls were neatly aligned, with canvas roofs, and they contained beautiful objects like those one glimpses when the window is open in fine houses. One went to see them, one gave them a glance, it did not seem they were there for any other reason. One counted them, one said: For the festival, there were five stalls! One was rather proud to live in a town to which, on the day of the festival, five stalls came to set themselves up!

Charles Blanchard was greatly astonished. An idea came to him which took hold of him entirely, which he began to follow and which carried him right into the midst of the stalls as if he were seeing them for the first time.

If he had held one of their rifles in his hands, he would have pressed the stock to his shoulder, he would have taken aim, one would have heard the sound the cap makes: there it is, I have fired a rifle! The Aunt Sally was set up in the very same stall as the shooting gallery. Time enough to set down his rifle, a step to the left, and he who had already thrown stones, he would have thrown balls at five for a sou. But the lottery! There was an all-blue vase, big as a head, with white flowers; one would have sworn they resembled daisies. When you have won it, the vendor places it in your arms. It is because you do not know what to do with it that you are happy.

It was only at eleven o'clock, a little before the congregation emerged from mass, that the wooden horses were freed from the veil which, until then, had hidden them from all eyes. Before eleven o'clock in the morning, no one would have been capable of imagining what pleasure is. There was something like an explosion. It seemed that a troop, hidden beneath the tent, had been waiting only for this moment to escape with violence, and by surprise to seize hold of everything around it.

It did not even take a minute:

"There it is!"

The whole world belonged to the wooden horses.
