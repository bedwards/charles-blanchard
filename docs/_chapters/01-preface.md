Philippe wrote, in a letter: "I am working on a new book which will be about my father. I had not yet told you. Besides, it is only at the beginning. I follow his life step by step; it seems to me that I am accompanying him; I rediscover his ideas, his ways of seeing things. He serves as my guide; I remember all that he used to tell me. One is not entirely dead when one has left such memories to one's own..."

It was most often after lunch, under the fire of the pipe and the black eye of the coffee, in the small room, clean and not very well lit, at Cerilly, that Philippe's father would tell him stories... This bothered Madame Philippe somewhat, who would have liked to clear her table and who kept turning and returning.... "That's enough. Leave us a moment longer," Philippe would say.

Carlyle writes somewhere: "The fact alone matters. John Lackland passed this way. That is what is admirable. That is a reality for which I would give all the theories in the world." Poincare adds: "A physicist would say: 'John Lackland passed this way; that matters nothing to me, since he will not pass again.'" If Philippe adored facts and stories, his mother, with that faculty of renewal which belongs to women, their practical sense and their instinct for facing the present, perhaps did not much like hearing again of the bad days. Besides, one has the sense that his father closed himself off, whether from simplicity, or from pride, or from instinctive distrust, if not from a worker's aversion who ploughs his furrow each day for all that paperwork, as soon as he knew that his Louis wanted to make a book about him. Other letters of Philippe make this quite clear. He writes to Mile:

"My father says there is no book to be made about him. People would say: 'This is not interesting. It is the story of a man who works. Nothing extraordinary has happened to him. It is the story of a man who has only done his duty...'"

And to his mother: "You tell me, my dear mother, that my father did not want me to make a book about him. This book, I had already begun it before his death, and it was not quite what my father might have believed. I draw from his life the fine example he gave me. My father could not prevent me from thinking that he had always done his duty, and from expressing it in my own way. I am quite certain besides that he would have accepted with pride and with joy the homage I would have paid him, and the thing above all that would have struck him is that he would have understood that I had made this book because I loved him with all my heart. I would like this book to be a fine book and for it to teach those who read it that a loyal and courageous man who was my father lived a life of work..."

And to Mile again: "My father does not tell me much, always because there is nothing to write about him. And then, he does not wish to occupy people..."

But Philippe knew enough. The contour of Charles Blanchard traced itself sufficiently from these tales for him to be able to fill it with his imagination, with his tenderness and with the memories of his own childhood, which had been spent at Cerilly, like that of his father. He forgot nothing of his childhood. He knew well that we live a long while on those first contacts. How many times we went back together, step by step, to wake all that slept of ourselves, behind us, at the roadside. Our questions multiplied... The old echoes rushed forward, from the depths of evening, at their call...

...Memory, memory, what do you want of me? Autumn...

We would have wished to flush from their finest folds our most distant memories. We entered the houses that had watched us live and depart, one day, at the end of some horizon of France, or in a town, at the end of a street... We found again in their drawers those shafts of light, those revelations, those keen keys which had once opened for us the chambers of Mystery, of art, of sorrow and of love. What a book one might write of it. One would try there to unfold well, to spread out well these sensations and these memories, with the humblest scruple, with the patience and the minuteness of a naturalist who prepares an insect, with the application of a child who writes a birthday greeting while sticking out his tongue. One would go back up through the old days, helping oneself with the smallest things, groping, as one finds with one's foot, while searching for them, the roughnesses of a wall to climb it... One would repeat one's childhood, like a class... One would disentangle all the threads, with one's naivete of old become almost a learned thing. One would soon reach the moment when one becomes conscious of the existence of one's parents, of their ways of moving against one another, of their cares, of their tuggings and their truces, of their relations with the child that you are, of all that they open for you, of the clearings and the vistas where they limit you. And then, there is the time of the first spectacles which mark you... The senses exercise themselves and exalt themselves. The brain takes in things well and controls. One grasps the first relations. One already has memories, at various planes, with their magic, their music and their odour. I, I would tell him how one day I had been troubled by the aspect of a locksmith's shop before which I passed every day with my mother, and which threw at us, through its blue door, the brief sign of a fire that thrust out its tongue when the great bellows breathed, the smell of its filings and the owl-body of its anvil... A herbalist's shop, further on, caressed you with its smell of nocturnal wood, of mulberries and of seeds... More than one thing in this world thus called to a certain child who was named Charles Blanchard, and of whom Philippe already spoke with the greatest insistence. When Galand, the blacksmith of his small town, in the company of his workman, beat the red iron, a rain of sparks would leap forth and radiate so beautifully that one rejoiced at having lived long enough to be able to contemplate it. -- The Chinese kiosk in the garden of Monsieur Tardy was capped with a roof of six angles at each of which was suspended a little bell, and when the wind blew, six little bells would ring. Through an open window one perceived the drawing-room of Madame Bonnet who was a very rich woman. Charles Blanchard had received from it something like a blow! He had been truly struck in the face by silk curtains, by carpets, by sofas, by vases and by lamps with copper columns which seemed to him to number at least fifty. There was also the house of Madame Emile Giron: its courtyard, its steps, its gate. And even, one day, he had climbed the steps!

Later, there was also the market of the small town: "He had a whole revelation. It was as if a new sense were making a place for itself among those he already used to appreciate the Universe. There occurred a phenomenon comparable to a landslide; a part of himself collapsed and left in the very middle of his body, in his belly, an enormous void. -- It seemed for a long while to Charles Blanchard that he saw more things still than are contained in a single market, that he even saw things that one does not see at the market."

-- But these were separate organs, which did not live, anatomical pieces. They were elements too pure still, isolated, unarmed, and which had not enough force to break the moorings of his soul and carry it off -- as by a ravishment... The spectacle of the wooden horses of the fete of his small town composed the first great ensemble, the first multiple body where several organs help each other to live, and, if I may write this word, the first symbiotic association, the first chemical phenomenon, the first mordant which made effervescence with that soul: It was chained to the leaf of a door, like Andromeda to her rock. But the wooden horses arrived in great heroism, like Perseus on his hippogriff... Charles Blanchard was profoundly shaken by it, intoxicated, converted, saved, as at the height of a high mass... And his soul was delivered!

Charles-Louis Philippe as a child received the same revelation, in the same square, at Cerilly, when he saw later, in his turn, the wooden horses of the same fete... He told me of his enthusiasm and his fever for a whole day. And we would speak again of the fetes of the Centre of France, of the "assemblies" of Berry and of the Bourbonnais, of their feastings and their weddings. I see him so well, small but stocky, the chest broad, the head strong, with its clear planes, raising his good face to meet the confidence, with his pince-nez, which had nothing of the bureaucratic, seated cross-legged on his well-open nose -- and walking with a short, neat step!

Here then is the first tangent by which Mystery grazed the mind of Charles Blanchard, as by a gust of wind sowing its seed: an image. It germinates and grows. There will come from it later a flower, a kind of passion-flower, the wooden horses of a small fete, in the midst of the pages of a book...

As soon as he had set himself to write it, Philippe suffered from an unease. He had told me of the bitter pleasure that filled him in painting the life of a child in his small town, his first thoughts, his first outings, his first happinesses and his discoveries; of a child very delicate of soul and of body; of a child traversed, transfixed by life as by an arrow of implacable sunlight; of a child whom the light dissolves, whom the air suffocates, and whom work threatens -- but whom work will save! Work, the double-edged weapon which kills you and which makes you live. He read to us one day, to Jehl and to me, what he had written of that first chapter of Charles Blanchard which he began again so many times since: It is a primitive's painting, with all its faith, its raw conscience, its planes and its backgrounds richly peopled, its fine care for exactitude. One thinks of the account of the first man's day, by Buffon.

Never had Philippe the need to say all, to forget nothing, as in "Charles Blanchard". But this very need embarrasses him, delays him and harasses him with scruples.

From the outset, everything becomes complicated.

He feels it by turns, and with equal certainty, in major and in minor. The light changes endlessly on his landscape. The choice of states, of "motifs" and of phenomena troubles him.

Is he going to let himself be intimidated? Is he going to mark the tendency, or submit to all that presents itself and let the planes people themselves as they will?

The "general book" and the particular: The story of Charles Blanchard; the Book of the Poor -- dispute over Philippe.

His taste for "experimentation without preconceived idea" struggles with his Vision of the world...

The multiplicity of points of view troubles him: Philippe has the scientific spirit. He cannot see a phenomenon begin without pursuing it.

He is muddled by reasoning. Each time he fixes on his problem, so many solutions propose themselves. As soon as he presses one, the others rush forward to deliver it!

He who believed there was nothing to do but follow, he sees too many paths forming beneath his steps. They branch off ceaselessly onto the two great lines: A natural road -- a strategic road. The realist line, and the other. -- On which, and how far will he follow his father? How to bring him to work? By the path of schoolchildren, or of martyrs?...

He will say later: "Shall we write Charles Blanchard, the child of misfortune, or Charles Blanchard the consoling young man?"

All the facts carry him off to their law. All the states raise him to their paroxysm. If there is a "hierarchy of facts," Philippe is constantly borne from secondary facts to facts of great yield. We shall see him tugged without respite from the state of emotion to the state of observation, from the sentimental state to the state of definition or hypothesis... A repressing and reducing Philippe struggles with the other...

We are going to witness once more an episode of this multiple struggle between the need for generalisation and experience, the "dogmatic and the historical", nature and intelligence.

He must follow and mark first that the wooden horses signify something quite other than a single bouquet and a single cake for a whole arid and sickly childhood, and that this "fete cake" is poisoned: Charles Blanchard bites into it and his teeth are bruised on the bean: a hard truth: "One evening, I seated Beauty on my knees and I found her bitter." -- The poison will remain in all our veins... Philippe, this time, paints his wooden horses like an extraordinary sunflower and like a new wonder of the world, but like a terrible discovery, with all its consequences. The aspect of the market of his small town makes Charles Blanchard understand that he is hollow and that he is hungry. The wooden horses make him understand that he is poor. He runs to ask his mother for a sou! This sou, a screwdriver, would open the door that separates you from the other classes. -- As in the day of the first man, he then becomes conscious of the limits of his existence: Where the goat is tied, there it must browse, and: When one has not what one loves, one must love what one has. There he is, cast back by the wooden horses into his class and into his house: "It is thus that houses are powerful, that things are greedy, that a great communion has been established in the world, that all things draw together, that he who can yield must yield, and that he who can yield yields with such weakness that one feels that God has willed it. Unable to conform their soul to ours, the objects that surround us conform our soul to theirs." It is then that Charles Blanchard, fallen back into his house, pushed back near the friends from whom his heart had strayed, looks a little better at what he had seen so ill and makes a fuller acquaintance with Bread: It is tender, then stale, then sandy. His mother makes an economy of it. She mounts guard around its crumbs. But there is also the Rent, which is an intimate enemy, and the expenses, with which one cannot help but exchange a few words, and the clothes, which must be renewed because one has grown. But if one grows, it is by Bread? Bread itself makes war on Bread! Solange, in vain, seeks work, makes false calculations and tries to cheat with bread. Vanquished and weary, she weeps over her defeat and resolves to beg.

It is that Philippe, when he goes back up the course of his youth, when he thinks of the life of his father, of all that he has heard said of it, of all that he has heard him tell of his pain, of the continuity of his effort, and from whatever side he turns and walks, strikes against days of stone, against winter sonorities... Someone relates that Flaubert worked sometimes under the impression of a certain colour, and pressed the material until he made it suggest the idea of that colour: "Thus, in Salammbo, I wanted to make a yellow thing." Philippe, thus, found himself little by little led to make, by amalgamating what he knew of the youth of his father with his own memories, with all the phantoms, with all the poor elements which fluttered, like Saint Elmo's fires, around his characters, a poor thing, a thing more and more poor; the Book of the Poor. The further he advanced into Charles Blanchard, the more he found himself drawn far, into regions more and more cold and sombre, and as into the limbo where live the larvae and the tadpoles of Misery... He was passing from Poverty into Misery. He told me of the torment that dwelt in him to make something horribly arid and desert-like. He sought to make his characters stand on the weakest possible bases, and which should be just exactly sufficient to keep one's balance there. He wanted to show from as close as possible that the Blanchards are aided only by the smallest number of foreign forces that can assist a being, and that they have around their sad bodies only just what is needed of external matter to prop up, to drag along, to prolong the poor life one has received. It is a little earth, a pot too narrow for its plant, a twig where an insect crawls at the edge of an abyss. And it is the Interior where the two Blanchards keep themselves, these two fakirs of misery, like two bodies one might come to see, petrified by some eruption, in the posture where death would have surprised them. -- Everything there smells of the odour of poor country interiors, the smell of clay, the smell of ink of the extinguished hearth, the smell of mouldy shadow of the open and empty chest. Philippe wants one to touch there the bottom of Misery, but of that immobile misery, fascinated and fatalist, where one soaks as in a bath, and which cools by degrees until the heat of the body can no longer even maintain itself there; of that misery where one lies as in a provisional vault, just above one's tomb. Everything there seems always within two fingers of death. Everything there gives the impression of an unstable equilibrium impossible to maintain, and not of an approaching fall, but of a consumption which drags itself along, and of a night-light in which there is no more oil and which never finishes going out...

"The four walls watched over the room, full of rough stones, with nothing to soften their hardness, in a terrible vis-a-vis, in an implacable severity, four walls between which the black floor was bare. The shadow they poured, troubled by the greenish daylight of a low window, had withdrawn into the corners waiting for its hour. When evening comes here, one will be quite alone in a very hard world. There still remained a table, three chairs, the bed and the bread-bin. One of the chairs was crippled. The other furniture had departed long since.

"One still had at one's disposal all that one can draw from oneself: There is Boredom which yawns and enters your mouth where it meets Hunger which rises, and which the prisoner seeks to appease by the infinitely slow and concentrated study of his dungeon. One also possesses tears. One can occupy oneself in weeping them, as a spider secretes its web. And the Cold still provides you with occupations: To know one's body, to lose it and to find it again: 'I no longer feel my feet,' said Solange. One can work at not being cold. Feed a thin fire with stones. And there is still Bread, with which one can make a thousand experiments. With such poor materials, one is quite forced to remake and to rediscover the World. Solange, one day, is reduced to discovering her own child!"

No. Never had Philippe the need to say all, to bring out all, and, to use a military expression, to "install" as in Charles Blanchard. He hungers there, more than ever, for total sincerity and absolute exactitude. The words there burst with meaning. The thoughts are rigorous. He will not forget a single one of all the ways the poor man invents of using the bread that remains to him. This idea of Misery, which, despite all, remains abstract for some of the best and boldest among men, for those very ones who emerge from their ivory shell, but who have never thought that they might descend one day into its Cellar, it does not suffice for him to make them pass it, feel it, smell it, in an irresistible concrete vision, and to push them brusquely into its intimacy, right up against its Face, as through a door open onto the cold night. He wants still to make them know it as a condemned man knows his cell. He wants to make of Charles Blanchard the depositary of a knowledge he possesses as a specialist and which makes of him one of the representative men among whom humanity chooses its heroes: The stone he brings to the great human knowledge, it is the knowledge of Poverty, of poverty unto Misery, unto asphyxiation by misery -- and unto Work, which opens the window! He turns and returns his character. He complicates him, he develops him, he simplifies him in every direction. He models him and he presses him like a terrible statuette. He makes him leave his hovel to beg his bread with his mother, and he drags him through the landscape, until he makes him surpass and dominate that landscape after having subordinated him to it... Without respite, he rolls him and plunges him into his misery, from the day when the wooden horses made him become conscious of it, until the day when he makes him discover, at the clog-maker's, the trick: lever, jack and master-key -- which makes you get out of it! Principle of perpetual motion, talisman, Aladdin's lamp which can make a fortune spring forth, unit of life: Work! With the joy of one who finally finds his balance; with the joy of someone who thinks for the first time in a foreign language; with the joy of a child who sees for the first time the movement of a watch; with the joy of one who knows how to swim! -- For I know nothing which pours a light as joyful as that little phrase which triggers itself all alone, one day, like a ripe fruit, from the mind of Charles Blanchard: "Uncle, would you like me to try to split your wood?"

Philippe thus writes Charles Blanchard like a book of object lessons, of impassioned object lessons "on some faculties of the soul." One has by turns the impression of a travel account in a mortal country by its explorer, of a sort of popularising course given by a technician, of a sort of "anatomy lesson" of the poor, of a sort of Francinet of the poor. But from the particular case which occupies him, from the detail where he leans, where he sinks, where he lies down, where he takes his scrupulous observation, his atrocious and clear-sighted enthusiasm, his terrible curiosity of a sick doctor who treats himself and makes his own observation, his desperate conscience which tortures itself and turns the iron in its own wound, his morose delectation in depicting all -- he is sent back, as by a spring, to the General... And he strikes there with all his strength until the lightning leaps from it and his lyricism, long brooded over by the vigilant examination of facts, takes its flight and carries him off to the sanctification of misery and of work!

But this very need for exactitude and sincerity labours Philippe in every direction. It often tears him away from his Poor Man. It makes him come back meanwhile from his typical Charles Blanchard. He sees another quite steady, the senses attentive, and who has nothing in common with the first, the tadpole... He walks in his small town where the work is gay, the life easy, and which represents the whole world. Hours of happiness file past in the sun and in joy. But the weather darkens. The sea of Misery swells and rises. The old wounds reopen. The other time, you saw a sensitive child before a merry-go-round, at a small fete; now you see a poor child before the wheel of Fortune. The most beautiful image of happiness serves only to make us understand that this happiness is not for us. Philippe thinks again and begins anew...

And each time he begins anew, one sees well that he feels once more the sense of a false start. His hole fills up as fast as he digs at it.

His uncertainty does nothing but grow as he feels a tendency of Charles Blanchard take shape.

He feels it swell, enrich itself with a thousand tributaries, rise in him like a wave and murmur with a suppliant voice.

He is led further and further by a vein, towed further and further by his instinct for direction.

The material has tired itself on the space where he works. The line bites only to the side, further, always further.

We see successively weigh themselves in his mind: The life of Charles Blanchard, the life of a poor child, the life of a man who emerges from poverty through work, the book of the poor, the book of misery, a sort of critical poem on the sanctification of misery. And there will be Charles Blanchard as there will have been Caesar and Julien Sorel...

This book evolves like an organ, alters itself, entangles itself, heals itself, deduces itself from its own substance and multiplies itself by itself from day to day. One sees no progress in it, but new parallels which form there. No boring so deep, nothing so hollowed out, so hard, in any literature.

From a deep-seated horror of playing at facility, from ambition of conscience and of scruple, for wanting to make too many things fit there and to realise too subtle an equilibrium, he ends by abandoning it. To take it up again later, say some. Philippe judged that the hardest part was done and that he had to let it rest. Definitively, say others. Charles Blanchard, in Philippe's eyes, emerges from his "developer" at the very moment when he emerges from poverty by the discovery of work. What remains to him? Years of apprenticeship and a man's life. And Philippe has described or indicated them everywhere else. -- But what must one think of this sentence: "It is here that 'the grandfather' ended his sad days"?...

The chapters we publish of the unfinished Charles Blanchard are not therefore "studies" which he made for a painting, but this painting itself, which he began again as many times as he believed he saw it in the conditions necessary for its definitive completion, and perhaps as the events of his own life became clogged or untied, and as his thoughts darkened or lightened... Such is the terrain, such are the reasons where these variants and these repetitions are played out. We had therefore to publish them as they are, one upon another and in their successive states, as one superimposes the portraits of the same family to obtain from them a sort of type. And I hold that on no battlefield has one seen so clearly in conflict, a will and events; feeling and critical sense; instinct and scruple; intelligence and nature; a great writer and his work...

Here is a variant where it is no longer Charles Blanchard who runs to find his mother to ask her for the sou which would open to him the enchanted garden. It is she who goes to see him at the fete, as one would go to see an ascetic in ecstasy, and makes him fall from his dream, as one wakes a sleepwalker: "He turned around: It was only she!" In another, it is not the lack of a sou which casts Charles Blanchard back into his class. He has no need of this proof to let himself fall back there. For he feels, simply, the disproportion which exists between the life of the wooden horses and their guests, and his own. He would have it, his sou, and he would not even dare use it! From the pocket, poverty passes into the heart, with time. Besides, he is conscious of having already taken more than his share of the fete: He has dared to slip into this tournament of nobles, to run all around, and to touch a great red horse! -- Elsewhere, the wooden horses help him above all to classify men. He only finally understands these, whom he had seen badly until then, by their conjunction with those. Charles Blanchard takes the measure of his own means and of his Destiny by the aspect of the means of others, and he perceives what he cannot do by seeing them do what they do. -- In yet another, Charles Blanchard weeps over himself or over his interior brother, who can do nothing for him. (Like Charles Blanchard, I remember having wept, long ago, before a painting which represented a fortified castle with its towers under a stormy sky, and before a great heap of sand where rich children dug canals full of running water and tunnels -- in the feeling of my powerlessness to possess them or to remake them...) Charles Blanchard experiences yet again, elsewhere, that feeling that he is extra, that he is too many, that he has no right, not even a niche, and that it is not only the wooden horses which are forbidden him, but all the life which begins at the edge of his waiting: No place has been reserved for him. He must therefore constantly profit from the movement to plug one, as in the game of four corners. Charles Blanchard will always be like those who enter by fraud into a theatre, and who, everywhere they slip in, suffer from the anguish of being chased by those who will come to occupy their place. -- A repetition completes by some details and on certain points the first chapter of Charles Blanchard which appeared in the Nouvelle Revue Francaise. Philippe there somewhat harshly specifies the bent, folded, huddled attitude on her chair, of Solange Blanchard. And this time, it is she who tastes her tears and no longer Charles. And this time, Charles is motionless: "Who then said that Charles Blanchard would go to see the kiosk of Monsieur Tardy?" There is a version of the interior of the clog-maker where a little girl appears, with her own way of seeing Charles Blanchard and of being afraid of this fearful one... It is the chapter of the bad welcome, as there is another of the good welcome. (At the end of this variant, one reads: "It was here that Charles Blanchard ended his life." Lower, in pencil: "The grandfather (and it is a nickname that had been given to Charles Blanchard) lived there the last days of his life. It seemed that he had forever left the place where he led an active life. He had come there to take his retirement.") -- There is yet another portrait of the little girl, as a little housewife, where there is not yet any question of her being afraid of Charles Blanchard. -- There is also a vigorous description, and a description in a note of gentle, passive, somewhat weak well-being, of the clog-maker's house. -- In a third, he no longer works in the intoxication of a healthy struggle, but with the hatred and the cruelty of an angry beast...

A small study completes the Market with new touches. Charles Blanchard is hungry. He awaits a miracle! At home, in the dirty light, he had the nausea of cheese. But, in the brightness of the clear market, he would go so far as to eat some! Notes where Philippe speaks of himself and of his childhood memories go back to the earliest origins of the book. Others reinforce the portrait of Charles Blanchard, or contain village sayings or accessory remarks.

Not one of these states, not one of these variants is lit by the same light nor at the same angle as the others. An always new design emerges from it, an always significant detail stands out in relief. And many are contradictory. "Shall we write Charles Blanchard, the child of misfortune, or Charles Blanchard the consoling young man?" If Philippe still oscillates between the two faces, it is because he is, more than ever, at one with his book, with the "fundamental plurality" of the Self, now master of his maladies and his fevers, now dominated by them... And it is when it concerns ourselves that we see most distinctly that there is no entire character, but nothing but scattered traits of character, interchangeable, and whose proportion ceaselessly varies... Happy? Unhappy? All is perhaps a question of point of departure. And then, one is so all at once, or by turns, and it is covered wills and forces which decide it and which strike the dominant. "The brain of man is a theatre where several different plays are performed at once on several planes of which only one is in the light."

One may well paint oneself in several manners, or subordinate one to the other, or make them all march abreast without ceasing to be truthful... Mallarme dreamed of a book where two different stories would pursue each other, as in hide-and-seek, one on the recto, the other on the verso. But if the man moves, all mingles, and the light plays tricks with the shadow. Thus Philippe turns with his book, as at the foot of a tree, his shadow.

He stops there in the midst of the struggle, exhausted from pushing into it all the sincerity of his heart. Everywhere else, he has succeeded in projecting his characters outside himself, he gives them nothing more than his gaze, he follows their actions and runs after them, and plays with them as at pass-the-slipper. But Charles Blanchard still possesses him. He gnaws at his belly, like the Spartan's fox. He shakes him with his starts and his rages. They sink and rise together. -- One sees him struggle with himself. It is no longer a question of "choosing". And then, when one is Philippe, one chooses with difficulty within oneself, one does not conjure away oneself. -- The thing must be said: this new child of his flesh cannot come out, because the term has not come...

The struggle is dear to me above all others where I see pass so many signs of that immense duality which turns in us all like a lighthouse, for as little as we may be sensitive and sincere. Parallelly, says Verlaine. But I have never followed it better than in the life and in the work of Philippe. It went in him as far as conflict, for he did nothing without flame. We have the need for bias and the gift of good faith; the desire to explain all and that of trusting to our instinct; the mystical and the sceptical; the feeling for the sacrifices it is necessary to make to the whole and the taste for the passionately equitable and careful examination of all that presents itself; the care for composition and the pleasure of seeing things grow and compose themselves, in the course of time and of function; the taste for the exceptional a la Dostoevsky, but often the need to envisage all from a point of view of western justice somewhat morose; the balance of the Right and the Duty of man, the "I prefer an injustice to a disorder," of Goethe, and the most precious respect for the individual; the appetite for pleasure and the torment of keeping oneself short; the mania for liberty and the itch for discipline; the profound knowledge of our weakness and the pretension of proving to ourselves our strength. Whatever may be said of that Truth of which Monos and Una speak; of that truth of which one is so hungry and which one is so strongly pressed to know, when certain signs warn you and the Unknown breathes its breath, of that truth which still raises on his pallet the dying man of Death and Transfiguration, Philippe sought it passionately. Now that he has been reabsorbed into immense love, that he has risen again, "at last", that he is on the side where it is true, no doubt, that he knows and that he holds the keys of the Portals and that he has ceased to live in order to be, does he touch a little of that truth, does he touch a little of its immense body? And can that console us for no longer being able to clasp him in our arms?
