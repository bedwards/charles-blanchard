V / THE CAROUSEL HORSES

They were gathered in the square, they followed one another in a movement ever equal to itself, they passed before your eyes, each in his rank, he who was there showed himself to you entire, then came a second, came a third, there came still more from behind, they had the number, they had the variety of forms; the splendour of one among them added to the splendour of the others, the magnificence grew and grew, and in a blare of fanfare, a dizzying procession passed before you, which was certainly composed of each of its riders, but which, gathering them all together, totalled a thousand glories, and passed in its brilliance, in its pride and in its majesty to celebrate one of those festivals in which all humanity joins. It was not a matter of wooden horses, it was not a matter of a joy one purchases for a sou.

Charles Blanchard had a surprise for which he was scarcely prepared. The carousel of wooden horses was not at all what he had at first believed...

Certainly the carousel contained horses, these horses were even, to the point of mistaking them, like living horses. Not only did they possess stirrups, a tail, a bridle—they possessed also a mane. But the carousel itself was worth far more than its horses. It would have been difficult to say whether the carousel was red or whether it was gold. Its colours seized hold of you, one knew not which to love best. One saw there oriflammes, banners, gilded columns, artificial flowers, fringes. One saw there things whose names one could scarcely recall. Copper lamps swung from above, suspensions. A mingling of riches took hold in you of all those sentiments capable of admiration. You were very nearly forgetting to notice blue globes, white globes, yellow globes, which were mirrors, which must have been diamonds, which were, along with the sun, what shines most brightly in all the world. They had hung them a little everywhere. The organ made one think of pianos.

One day, through an open window, the child had glimpsed the salon of Madame Leon Bonnet who was a very rich woman. He had received a blow from it. He had been truly struck in the face by silk curtains, by carpets, by sofas, by flower vases, by lamps with copper columns which seemed to him to number at least fifty. When he wished to boast, he would say:

—I have seen the salon of Madame Bonnet.

The carousel made one think of that salon. One would have been mistaken in trying to enumerate all its beauties. The carousel was comparable to palaces, the carousel was comparable to those salons one glimpses but once in a lifetime, the day when the window stands open.

Charles Blanchard had never set foot there, he would never have dared set foot there. He knew he was not made to cross its threshold.

Toward four o'clock in the afternoon, the people who until then had had their affairs, those who are always late, the girls who had gone to the dance hall for a turn on the floor, the last inhabitants of the small town in a word, with their children, with their friends, with the persons they had met along the way, came around the carousel of wooden horses to take the place each has the right to occupy. They advanced, as people advance, with the need to reach the front rank. A rather great movement resulted from this, as when new generations, pushing aside what hinders them, wish to make their place in the sun. It was a matter then of holding firm so that they might not dislodge you from the post you had conquered well before them. No one failed in this. One even heard the sound of several quarrels. Charles Blanchard knew a sentiment he had not yet felt. It would not suffice to call it respect. It was not before numbers, it was not before force that he yielded. He might, moreover, have profited from the push he was given, and, advancing a few steps, carried by the crowd, occupied the front rank without even having done so on purpose. He was careful not to. He saw these ones coming, he saw those ones coming, each of them walked with assurance as when a man walks in his own domain. Before even they were installed there, Charles Blanchard, with attentive eye, considered the spot which they seemed to wish to choose. When they approached it, he stepped aside with obedience, abandoned the ground to them and went off a few steps further, into a corner, to take the place they had been willing to leave him.

Charles Blanchard did not fight. At no moment did it come to his mind that he might have struggled as the others struggled, and, playing with elbows, head and knees, beaten down in the human wall what would have been needed to give passage to his body. In the thickness of the mass, not a crack, not a fissure, not a hole; the row of spectators held its post with the firmness of old soldiers guarding their country. It was not a matter of grieving over this; it was not a matter of wishing it were otherwise: it was thus. The child stepped back a few paces. He crossed his two small hands upon his belly, and, legs apart, head straight, he planted himself with solidity and occupied the place that had been assigned to him. He blinked his eyelids, he breathed, he lived, he thought; when he was weary of having crossed his hands upon his belly, he crossed them behind his back. He occupied the last place with naturalness. He had two blue eyes, those eyes of children that are larger than the eyes of men because they have not yet seen anything and they need to see many things. He contemplated the spectacle he was admitted to contemplate. The backs of men were thick because many wore smocks; the skirts of women were ample; there were no small children, because their mothers placed them in the front rank. Sometimes a broad wave, a surge of pleasure running in from some corner seized hold of them. The laughter of people who are enjoying themselves passed from each to each, one saw it circulate, it shook the shoulders of men, it seemed that from one to another they were passing it along, no one let it fall. It was around the wooden horses an afternoon of gaiety. In the sky there was what was needed of clouds so that one might be in shade in every place. One gave oneself over to the fine weather, one gave oneself over to the wooden horses, to the day of the festival. In broad sheets, it seemed that happiness fell from the azure and spread over men some luminous joy in which they stood upright.

Then, in the deepest part of his heart, there where one possesses what is needed to understand, to taste, to love all the things of the earth, the child felt another Charles Blanchard who, crushed by shadow, could not live there and held out to the world a world of sentiments so beautiful that one would have to be ignorant of them not to feel pity for them. He strove to forget him, he buried him beneath the weight of his heaviest thoughts, he knew how to fight when it was a matter of that, he drowned him in such a flood of bitterness that his happy brother, the little Charles Blanchard so gentle whom he carried within him fell back silently as one falls back upon one's bed, and all is finished. It was as if he had a dead man in his house. He wept for him. Great tears flowed down his cheeks; one does not know how many he shed, they followed one another like memories, like thoughts follow one another, he was never at the last. He wept a long time, and when, toward evening, he set off quietly, he began again to weep upon the road.

It was thus that Charles Blanchard, at the age of ten, took among men the place of the poor. One is poor, first of all, for reasons of money. A sou would sometimes suffice for one not to become so. Soon it is too late. Poverty is no longer in their pocket, poverty has fixed itself in their heart. Charles Blanchard knew its first sentiments. He had not a revolt, he had not a complaint, it was as if the kingdom of God had already come and each had received his share. He bowed his head to accept his own.
