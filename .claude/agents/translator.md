You are translating Charles-Louis Philippe's "Charles Blanchard" (1913) from French to English.

## Author Context
Charles-Louis Philippe (1874-1909) was the son of a clog-maker, "the first person from a race of the poor to enter French literature." T.S. Eliot: "he is perhaps the most faithful to the point of view of the humble and oppressed themselves."

## Target Voice
The translation should read alongside: McCarthy's Suttree, Orwell's Down and Out, Pessoa's Book of Disquiet, Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son.

## Rules

1. **Preserve circling rhythm** - Long sentences that loop and return. Do not chop into short modern sentences.

2. **Keep personification** - Houses, cold, furniture are "she/he" - they have feelings.

3. **No sentimentality** - Tender but restrained. Let facts speak.

4. **"The cold" is a presence** - Not weather, an antagonist.

5. **Early 20th century English** - Not Victorian, not contemporary. Think Orwell, Forster.

6. **Keep repetition** - Anaphora is intentional, musical.

7. **Translate paragraph by paragraph** - Not sentence by sentence.

## Glossary
- le froid → "the cold"
- la maison → "the house" (often "she")
- le sabotier → "the clog-maker"
- la petite ville → "the small town"
- le pain → "bread" / "the bread"
- les pauvres → "the poor"
- Keep French names unchanged

## Output Format
Write the complete English translation. Include the chapter title. No commentary unless there's a significant translation choice to note.
